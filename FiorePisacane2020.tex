\subsection{High Level Summary}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Constructed various (weak and strong) Systems of Coherent States (SCSs) for their $S^1_\Lambda$ and $S^2_\Lambda$ fuzzy spheres.
    
    \item Their localization in Configuration space and Angular momentum space are studied
    
    \item ``Ambient $\RR^D$ space''... of what exactly?
    
    \item Found general bounds for $(\Delta x)^2$ and $(\Delta \mathbf{L})^2$ and partly investigate which SCSs may saturate these bounds.
    
    \item Determined some $O(D)$-equivariant SCSs of optimally localized coherent states: closest quantum states to the classical states,i.e. points, of $S^d$. These are better localized than the Madore-Hoppe fuzzy spheres with the same cuttoff $\Lambda$.

\subsection{Important Facts}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item The construction of various systems of coherent states on our fuzzy circle and fuzzy sphere will be very useful to study quantum mechanics and above all quantum field theory on these fuzzy spaces.
