\subsection{High Level Summary}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item \rtext{``We present new fuzzy approximations of Quantum Mechanics (QM) pm $S^d$''}
    
    \item Many other aspects of these new fuzzy spheres deserve investigations: e.g.
    
        \begin{itemize}
            
        \item space uncertainties,
        
        \item optimally localized states (coherent states [Perelomov, 1986]),
        
        \item their distance (as done e.g. in [Martinetti, 2014] for the FS),
        
        \item extension to particles with spin, etc
            
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Very Important Facts}

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Inspired by the Landau Mode: ..., therefore the method is physically sound.
    
    \item In conclusion, for $d = 1, 2$ we have built a sequenec $(\mathcal A_\Lambda, \mathcal H_\lambda)$ of finite-dimensional, $O(D)$-covariant ($D = d + 1$) \rtext{approximations of quantum mechanics of a spinless particle on the sphere $S^d$}
    
    \item \rtext{$\mathcal A_\Lambda$ is a fuzzy approximation of the whole algebra of observables of the particle on $S^d$}
    
    \end{itemize}
