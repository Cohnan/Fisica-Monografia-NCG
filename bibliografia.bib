@book{Moretti2017,
abstract = {2nd ed. This book discusses the mathematical foundations of quantum theories. It offers an introductory text on linear functional analysis with a focus on Hilbert spaces, highlighting the spectral theory features that are relevant in physics. After exploring physical phenomenology, it then turns its attention to the formal and logical aspects of the theory. Further, this Second Edition collects in one volume a number of useful rigorous results on the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics focusing in particular on von Neumann algebras, Superselection rules, the various notions of Quantum Symmetry and Symmetry Groups, and including a number of fundamental results on the algebraic formulation of quantum theories. Intended for Master's and PhD students, both in physics and mathematics, the material is designed to be self-contained: it includes a summary of point-set topology and abstract measure theory, together with an appendix on differential geometry. The book also benefits established researchers by organizing and presenting the profusion of advanced material disseminated in the literature. Most chapters are accompanied by exercises, many of which are solved explicitly. 1 Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds -- 2 Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications -- 3 Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators -- 4 Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties -- 5 Densely-Defined Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces -- 6 Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: an Overview -- 7 The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions, Quantum States and Observables -- 8 Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C -algebras and Operators in B(H) -- 9 Spectral theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces -- 10 Spectral Theory III: Applications -- 11 Mathematical Formulation of Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics -- 12 Introduction to Quantum Symmetries -- 13 Selected Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics -- 14 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories -- 15 Appendix A: Order Relations and Groups -- 16 Appendix B: Elements of Differential Geometry.},

@article{ChaobaDevi2018,
abstract = {Beginning with a review of the existing literature on the computation of spectral distances on noncommutative spaces like Moyal plane and fuzzy sphere, adaptable to Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation, we carry out a correction, revision and extension of the algorithm provided in [1] i.e. [F. G. Scholtz and B. Chakraborty, J. Phys. A, Math. Theor. 46 (2013) 085204] to compute the finite Connes' distance between normal states. The revised expression, which we provide here, involves the computation of the infimum of an expression which involves the "transverse" ($\delta$p$\tau$) component of the algebra element in addition to the "longitudinal" component $\delta$p of [1], identified with the difference of density matrices representing the states, whereas the expression given in [1] involves only $\delta$p and corresponds to the lower bound of the distance. This renders the revised formula less user-friendly, as the determination of the exact transverse component for which the infimum is reached remains a nontrivial task, but under rather generic conditions it turns out that the Connes' distance is proportional to the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\delta$p, leading to considerable simplification. In addition, we can determine an upper bound of the distance by emulating and adapting the approach of [P. Martinetti and L. Tomassini, Commun. Math. Phys. 323 (2013) 107-141]. We then look for an optimal element for which the upper bound is reached. We are able to find one for the Moyal plane through the limit of a sequence obtained by finite-dimensional projections of the representative of an element belonging to a multiplier algebra, onto the subspaces of the total Hilbert space, occurring in the spectral triple and spanned by the eigen-spinors of the respective Dirac operator. This is in contrast with the fuzzy sphere, where the upper bound, which is given by the geodesic of a commutative sphere, is never reached for any finite n-representation of SU(2). Indeed, for the case of maximal noncommutativity (n = 1/2), the finite distance is shown to coincide exactly with the above-mentioned lower bound, with the transverse component playing no role. This, however, starts changing from n = 1 onwards and we try to improve the estimate of the finite distance and provide an almost exact result, using our revised algorithm. The contrasting features of these types of noncommutative spaces becomes quite transparent through the analysis, carried out in the eigen-spinor bases of the respective Dirac operators.},

Introducing the notion of position and its measurement in the sense of a weak measurement (positive operator-valued measure), we find two equivalent pictures in a position representation: a constrained local description in position containing additional degrees of freedom and an unconstrained nonlocal description in terms of the position without any other degrees of freedom. Both these descriptions have a corresponding classical theory which shows that the concept of extended, structured objects emerges quite naturally and unavoidably there. It is explicitly demonstrated that the conserved energy and angular momentum contain corrections to those of a point particle. We argue that these notions also extend naturally to the quantum level. The local description is found to be the most convenient as it manifestly displays additional information about the structure of quantum states that is more subtly encoded in the nonlocal, unconstrained description. Subsequently, we use this picture to discuss the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This book develops the abstract theory along with a well-chosen selection of concrete examples that exemplify the results and show the breadth of their applicability. After a preliminary chapter containing the necessary background material on Banach algebras and spectral theory, the text sets out the general theory of locally compact groups and their unitary representations, followed by a development of the more specific theory of analysis on Abelian groups and compact groups. There is an extensive chapter on the theory of induced representations and its applications, and the book concludes with a more informal exposition on the theory of representations of non-Abelian, non-compact groups.},

First, we compute Connes' spectral distance associated with the natural isometric action of ℝ2 on the algebra of the Moyal plane A. We show that the distance between any state of A and any of its translated states is precisely the amplitude of the translation. As a consequence, we obtain the spectral distance between coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator as the Euclidean distance on the plane. We investigate the classical limit, showing that the set of coherent states equipped with Connes' spectral distance tends towards the Euclidean plane as the parameter of deformation goes to zero. The extension of these results to the action of the symplectic group is also discussed, with particular emphasis on the orbits of coherent states under rotations. Second, we compute the spectral distance in the double Moyal plane, intended as the product of (the minimal unitization of) A by ℂ2. We show that on the set of states obtained by translation of an arbitrary state of A, this distance is given by the Pythagoras theorem. On the way, we prove some Pythagoras inequalities for the product of arbitrary unital and non-degenerate spectral triples. Applied to the Doplicher- Fredenhagen-Roberts model of quantum spacetime [DFR], these two theorems show that Connes' spectral distance and the DFR quantum length coincide on the set of states of optimal localization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A high momentum (short distance) cut-off is implemented by the action of a projection P on the Dirac operator D and/or on the algebra A. This action induces two new distances. We individuate conditions making them equivalent to the original distance. We also study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the set of truncated states, first for compact quantum metric spaces in the sense of Rieffel, then for arbitrary spectral triples. To this aim, we introduce a notion of "state with finite moment of order 1" for noncommutative algebras. We then focus on the commutative case, and show that the cut-off induces a minimal length between points, which is infinite if P has finite rank. When P is a spectral projection of D, we work out an approximation of points by non-pure states that are at finite distance from each other. On the circle, such approximations are given by Fejér probability distributions.

   abstract = {The spin 1/2 Dirac operator and its chirality operator on the fuzzy 2-sphere S 2F can be constructed using the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) algebra [1]. This construction actually exists for any spin j on S 2F, and have continuum analogues as well on the commutative sphere S 2 or on ℝ 2. This is a remarkable fact and has no known analogue in higher dimensional Minkowski spaces. We study such operators on S 2F and the commutative S 2 and formulate criteria for the existence of the limit from the former to the latter. This singles out certain fuzzy versions of these operators as the preferred Dirac operators. We then study the spin 1 Dirac operator of this preferred type and its chirality on the fuzzy 2-sphere and formulate its instanton sectors and their index theory. The method to generalize this analysis to any spin j is also studied in detail. © SISSA 2009.},

   abstract = {Noncommutative geometry provides a powerful tool for regularizing quantum field theories in the form of fuzzy physics. Fuzzy physics maintains symmetries, has no fermion-doubling problem and represents topological features efficiently. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive introduction to the field. Starting with the construction of fuzzy spaces, using the concrete examples of the fuzzy sphere and fuzzy complex projective spaces, the book moves on to discuss the technology of star products on noncommutative R2d and on the fuzzy sphere. Scalar, spinor and gauge field theories as well as extended objects such as monopoles and nonlinear sigma modes are treated in considerable detail. A detailed treatment of the regularization of supersymmetry is given using the techniques of fuzzy physics.},

abstract = {A model of Euclidean spacetime is presented in which at scales less than a certain length kappa the notion of a point does not exist. At scales larger then kappa the model resembles the 2-sphere S2. The algebra which determines the structure of the model, and which replaces the algebra of functions, is an algebra of matrices. The order of n of the matrices is connected with the length kappa and the radius r of the sphere by the relation kappa approximately r/n. The elements of differential calculus are sketched as well as the possible definitions of a metric and linear connection. A definition of the path integral is given and a few examples of field theory on a fuzzy sphere are finally referred to.},

@book{Perelomov,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {For the description of an assembly of two-level atoms, atomic coherent states can be defined which have properties analogous to those of the field coherent states. The analogy is not fortuitous, but is shown to be related to the group contraction of exponential operators based on the angular momentum algebra to exponential operators based on the harmonic-oscillator algebra. The derivation of the properties of the atomic coherent states is made easier by the use of a powerful disentangling theorem for exponential angular momentum operators. A complete labeling of the atomic states is developed and many of their properties are studied. In particular it is shown that the atomic coherent states are the quantum analogs of classical dipoles, and that they can be produced by classical fields. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Physical Society.},

@article{DFR,
abstract = {We propose uncertainty relations for the different coordinates of spacetime events, motivated by Heisenberg's principle and by Einstein's theory of classical gravity. A model of Quantum Spacetime is then discussed where the commutation relations exactly implement our uncertainty relations. We outline the definition of free fields and interactions over QST and take the first steps to adapting the usual perturbation theory. The quantum nature of the underlying spacetime replaces a local interaction by a specific nonlocal effective interaction in the ordinary Minkowski space. A detailed study of interacting QFT and of the smoothing of ultraviolet divergences is deferred to a subsequent paper. In the classical limit where the Planck length goes to zero, our Quantum Spacetime reduces to the ordinary Minkowski space times a two component space whose components are homeomorphic to the tangent bundle TS2 of the 2-sphere. The relations with Conne's theory of the standard model will be studied elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag.},
