    - $H = - \frac{1}{2} \Delta + V(r)$ invariant under $O(D)$
    
    - Introducing the cutoff $\cut E$, as the energy where
    \begin{align}
        \label{eqn5}
            V(r) \approx V_0 + 2k(r-1)^2 && \text{for $r$ such that $V(r) \leq  \cut E$}.
    \end{align}
    %in the region $\nu_{\cut E} = \{r \,|\, V(r) \leq \cut E\}$.
    
    - Eigenfunctions of $H$ as product of a spherical harmonic $Y(\phi, \dots)$ (eigenvector of $L^2$) and an eigenfunction of the radial equation 
    \begin{align}
        \label{eqn9}
        \left[-\partial_r^2 - (D-1) \frac{1}{r} \partial_r + \frac{1}{r^2} j(j+D-2) + V(r)\right] \tilde f(r) = E \tilde f(r).
    \end{align}
    - This last equation can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator equation, since outside the region $\{V(r) \leq \cut E\}$ $\psi$ is negligibly small.

    - Equation \eqref{eqn9} has the approximation, where $\rho := \ln r$
    \begin{equation}
        \label{harmonic2D}
        \hat H f(\rho) = e_m f(\rho), \qquad
        \hat H = - \partial_\rho^2 + k_m(\rho - \tilde \rho_m)^2,
    \end{equation} $
        k_m := 2(k - E'), \quad
        E' := E - V_0, \quad
        \tilde \rho_m := \frac{E'}{k_m}, \quad
        e_m = \frac{E'^2}{k_m} + E' - m^2
    $
    - The solutions $f_{n,m}$ are known, $n \in \bb N, m \in \ZZ$ \then $e_{m, n}(k) = (2n+1)\sqrt{k_m}$ \then $E'_{m,n}(k)$ satisfies a quartic equation \then $E_{m,n}(k, V_0)$.
    
    - Fixing $V_0 = V_0(k)$ such that $E_{0, 0} = 0$ \then $V_0(k) = -\sqrt{2k} + 2 - \frac{7}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2k}} + o(1/k)$ and 
    $\sum_{n = -1}^\infty v_n \left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{k}} \right)^n \approx -\sqrt{2k} + 2 - o(1/k)$ \then
    \begin{equation}
        \rtext{E_{n, m}(k)} = m^2 + 2n\sqrt{2k} - 2n + o(1/\sqrt{k})
    \end{equation}
    
    - Choosing $\cut E < 2 \sqrt{2k} - 2$, the spectrum of $H$ is a truncation of $L^2$: \textbf{the radial oscillations are ``frozen''}: $\cut{\partial_r} = 0$.
    \begin{multline*}
        \lbtext{\psi_m(\rho, \phi)} := f_{0, m}(\rho) e^{im\phi} = c_m e^{im\phi}exp{\left[ -\frac{(\rho - \tilde \rho_m)^2 \sqrt{k_m}}{2} \right]} \\\xrightarrow{k \to \infty} \delta(r-1)e^{i m \phi}
    \end{multline*}
    \begin{equation}
        E = E_m(k) = m^2 + o(1/\sqrt{k})
    \end{equation}
    
    - For $\lbtext{\Lambda} := \lfloor \cut E \rfloor$, 
    \begin{align}
        \lbtext{\hcal_{\Lambda}}:= \lbtext{\hcal_{\cut E}} := span\{\psi_m\}_{|m| \leq 
    \lfloor \cut E \rfloor} ,
    \lbtext{\acal_\Lambda} := \mathcal B(\hcal_\Lambda)
    \end{align}
    
    - Since $H$ generates the time evolution, a
    An element of $\hcal_\Lambda$ doesn't evolve out of $\hcal_\Lambda$.
    
    - Get a fuzzy space: e.g. choosing $k = \Lambda^2(\Lambda+1)^2$ --make $k$ diverge with $\Lambda$ while $\nu_{\cut E}$ goes to $\{r = 1\}$
    
    - This cutoff entails replacing every observable by $A \mapsto \lbtext{\cut A} = P_{\cut E} A P_{\cut E}$% \dbtext{when?}

    - Up to infinite, $1/k^{1/2}\dbtext{?}$ and $1/k^{3/2}$ orders, respectively
    \begin{align}
    \label{projObs2D}
        \rtext{\cut L} \psi_m &= m \psi_m; & 
        \rtext{\cut H} &= \cut L^2; & 
        \rtext{\cut x^\pm} \psi_m = 
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{m(m \pm 1)}{k} } \psi_{m \pm 1} & -\Lambda \leq \pm m \leq \Lambda - 1 \\
                0 & \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
    \end{align}
    - And so, up to terms of $1/k^{3/2}$
    \begin{align}
        \label{conmObs2D}
        \cut{x^+}^\dagger &= \cut{x^-}; &
        [\cut L, \cut{x^\pm}] &= \pm \cut{x^\pm}; &
        \rtext{[\cut{x^+}, \cut{x^-}]} &= - \frac{\cut L}{k} + \left[1 + \frac{\Lambda(\Lambda+1)}{k}\right] (\tilde P_{\Lambda} - P_{-\Lambda})a^2.
    \end{align}
     - If \eqref{projObs2D} are used exactly to define elements of $\mathcal B(\hcal_\Lambda) \equiv \acal_\Lambda$ then \eqref{conmObs2D} are also exact, and $\cut{x^\pm}$ generate $\acal_\Lambda$. -- $\cut{\partial_\pm}$ are now redundant... but I'm not sure why
