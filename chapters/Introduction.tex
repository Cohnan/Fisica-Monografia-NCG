The Preliminaries chapter on NC manifolds in DAndrea2013 seems to be taken mainly from Gracia-Bondia 2001.

As manifold? What preserves differential structure

($A$ unital) States: (DAndrea 2013) $S(A)$ (norm completion of) set of states of $A$. Is an ``extended (allowing infinity) metric space'' under the Connes' metric / \lbtext{spectral distance}. The supremum is alwasy attaine don self-adjoint elements (noted in Iochum 2001). ... COMPACT QUANTUM METRIC SPACE $(A,  d_{D})$.
