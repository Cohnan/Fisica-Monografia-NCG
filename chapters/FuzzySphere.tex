In order to understand the formulation of spectral triples on a fuzzy space as well as their use to carry out distance calculations, in this chapter we review the study of the metric properties of the fuzzy sphere of Madore and Hoppe \cite{Madore} developed by D'Andrea, et al. in \cite{DAndrea2013}. 

Recall that the \emph{$2$-sphere}, denoted by $S^2$, is the set of points in $\RR^3$ located at an euclidean distance of $1$ unit from the origin. As a metric space and as a manifold it is rotationally invariant, that is, $SO(3)$-invariant. Since the group $SU(2)$ is the universal cover of the group of rotations $SO(3)$, we can translate this invariance to be a $SU(2)$-invariance. We will see that this invariance induces a decomposition of the canonical Dirac operator on $S^2$ that is compatible with the action of $SU(2)$. Truncating this $SU(2)$-decomposition will give rise to equivariant spectral triples on the fuzzy sphere of Madore and Hoppe, defined in Section \ref{ch2sectFuzzySphere}, which inherit some of the important properties of the canonical spectral triple as seen in Section \ref{CHFSSectionSpectralTriples}. A family of states studied in Section \ref{ChFSSectCoherentStates} called the \textit{spin coherent states} have some properties, including a $SU(2)$-equivariant bijective correspondence with the points in $S^2$, that motivate us to think of them as each one of the as a fuzzy analog of the points of $S^2$, and which allow us to say that the convergence of the fuzzy sphere to $S^2$ occurs as a metric space, on which $SU(2)$ acts by ``isometries''.

% \rtext{Starting point: $SU(2)$-isometries}%\cite{DAndrea2013}
% - $S^2$ as the symmetric space $S^3/S^1$ of the compact semisimple Lie group $G = S^3$, $\mathfrak g = su(2)$.
    
% - The canonical spectral triple, which is \textbf{$SU(2)$-equivariant} can be seen to come from a purely algebraic element $\lbtext{\mathcal D} \in U(\mathfrak g) \otimes U(\mathfrak g)$:
%     \begin{align*}
%         U(\mathfrak g) \otimes U(\mathfrak g) &\to& U(\mathfrak g) \otimes Cl(\mathfrak g, -K) &\to& \mathcal B(L^2(G/U, \Sigma G/U)) \\
%         1 \otimes 1 + 2 \sum_{k = 1}^3 J^k \otimes J^k &\mapsto& 1 \otimes 1 + \sum_k J^k \otimes \sigma_k &\mapsto& \rtext{\left( \bigoplus_{l\in \bb N} \pi_l \right) \otimes \pi_{1/2}(\mathcal D)}
%     \end{align*}
    
% (- In Sanchez: $\mu = 1, 2$
%  $\nabla_\mu = \partial_\mu - \frac{c_\mu}{q} \sigma_\mu \sigma_{\cut \mu} \cdot$, 
%  $\slashed D = -i \frac{q}{2} \sigma^\mu \nabla_\mu)$)

% - So $\lbtext{\slashed D} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \partial_H & \partial_F \\ \partial_E & 1 - \partial_H\end{pmatrix} = 1 + \partial_F \otimes \sigma_+ + \partial_E \otimes \sigma_- + \partial_H \otimes \sigma_3$ where $\partial_H = -i \partial_\phi$, $\partial_F = e^{i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta + i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right)$, $\partial_E = -\partial_F% = e^{-i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta - i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right)
% $ are the actions of $J^3$, $J^\pm \in i\,su(2)$ on $L^2(S^2)$ respectively. \textit{Eig. vectors}: orth. basis of $\hcal$; \textit{Spectrum} $= \{\pm l\} = \ZZ - 0$ with multiplicities $2l$. (The tensor with $2x\times 2$ matrices means that we are looking at spinors as column vectors $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} \cdot \\ \cdot \end{pmatrix}$)%: L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2 \to L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2 = \oplus_{l \in \bb N} (\pi_l \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D)$

% ( - The eigenvectors (spinor harmonics) $Y^{'}_{lm}, Y^{''}_{lm}$, $l \in \NN + 1/2$, of $D$ make up an orthogonal basis of the spinor fields $\hcal$.
%  - The eigenvalues are: of $Y'_{l\cdot}: (l + 1/2) \in \NN$, of $Y{''}_{l\cdot}: -(l + 1/2)$, with multiplicities $2l+1$)
% }

Although there are several ways to describe the canonical spectral triple on $S^2$, the one that will be useful later to define the spectral triples on the fuzzy sphere comes from understanding $S^2$ as the \ptext{compact Riemannian symmetric} $S^2 \cong G/U$ of the compact semisimple Lie group $G = SU(2)$, where we take $U = SO(2)$ as the invariant subgroup under the complex conjugation involution.

Let $G$ be a compact semisimple Lie group $G$ with (real) Lie algebra $\alg g$, where the semisiplicity means that the Killing form $K: \alg g \times \alg g \to \alg g$ of $\alg g$ is non-degenerate, and the compactness that $K$ is negative-definite giving $G$ a natural Riemannian manifold structure. For such a manifold $G$, and its symmetric spaces, the canonical Dirac operator can be seen to arise \cite{Huang2007} from an algebraic element $\lbtext{\dcal } \in U(\alg g)\times U(\alg g)$, where $\lbtext{U}(\alg g)$ is \lbtext{the universal enveloping complex algebra} of the Lie algebra $\alg g$, i.e. the largest unital, associative complex algebra containing $\alg g$ where the Lie bracket coincides with the commutator in $U(\alg g)$; it is important to remark that \otext{the representations of $\alg g$ are in a bijective correspondence with the modules over $U(\alg g)$}. In the explicit case where $G = SU(2)$,
\begin{equation}\label{equationALgebraicDiracOperatorDecomposition}
    \lbtext{\dcal} := 1 \otimes 1 + 2 \sum_{k = 1}^3 J^k \otimes J^k \in U(\sut) \otimes U(\sut)
\end{equation}
where $J^k \in U(\sut), k = 1, \dots, 3$ are the basis of $\sut\otimes \CC$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{equationCommutationRelationJs}
    [J^i, J^j] = i \epsilon_{ijk} J^k
\end{equation} (e.g. $J^k = \frac{\sigma_k}{2} = \pi_{1/2}(J^k)$). 

\lin

\begin{notation} \label{notRepSu2}
Let us denote by $\lbtext{\pi_j}: U(\sut) \to M_{2j+1}(\CC) = End(V_j)$, with $V_j := \CC^{2j+1}$, the spin $j \in \frac{\NN}{2}$ representation of $\sut$ where each element of the canonical basis $e_m \in \CC^{2j+1}$, $m = -j, \dots, j-1, j$ satisfies $\pi_j(\vec J^2)(e_m) = j(j+1) e_m$ and $\pi_j(J^3)(e_m) = m e_m$, where $\vec J^2$ is notation for $(J^1)^2 + (J^2)^2 + (J^3)^2 \in U(\sut)$. Recall each of these representations is unitary, and induces a unitary representation of $SU(2)$.
\end{notation}
 
Let $Y^l_m \in C^\infty (S^2)$, $l \in \NN$, $m \in \{-l, \dots, l-1, l\}$ be the spherical harmonics, and recall that, for each fixed $l$, they are an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert spaces $\tilde V_l := span\{Y^l_m\}_{|m| \leq l}$ which are simply the spaces of homogeneous complex polynomials on the coordinate variables $x^1, x^2, x^3$ restricted to $S^2$ (i.e. polynomials under the relation $(x^1)^2 + (x^2)^2 + (x^3)^2 = 1$). Hence, every continuous/smooth/square integrable function is the limit of linear combinations of spherical harmonics of increasing polynomial degree\footnote{More precisely, the vector space $\bigoplus_{l = 0}^\infty \tilde V_l$ is the space of polynomials restricted to the compact space $S^2$, and so the Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies that this subalgebra is dense in $C(S^2)$ under the uniform convergence norm topology, and hence also dense in $C^\infty(S^2) \subset C(S^2)$. Now, the compactness of $S^2$ also implies that $C(S^2)$ (and even $C^\infty(S^2)$, due to the existence of smooth bump functions) is dense in $L^2(S^2)$ with the L$2$ norm topology, thus the vector space of polynomials is also dense in $L^2(S^2)$ under this topology.}; 
in particular, 
\begin{equation} \label{decompL2S2}
L^2(S^2) = \bigoplus_{l = 0}^\infty \tilde V_l,
\end{equation}
where the direct sum is to be understood as the one for Hilbert spaces.
The spaces $\tilde V_l$ are precisely all the irreducible unitary representation spaces of $SO(3)$, acting inversely on the coordinate variables, and so they are another description of the spin-$l$ representation spaces $V_l$ of $SU(2)$. This decomposition (into invariant, irreducible subrepresentation spaces) of $L^2(S^2)$ is in fact the one induced by the action of $SU(2)$, inherited from the action on the base space $S^2$, and which can be seen to be induced by the natural action of $\soth \cong \sut$ on $S^2$ as vector fields of infinitesimal rotations. In particular, it can be shown that
\begin{align}
    \partial_H &:= - i \partial_\phi & \text{is the action of $\lbtext{H} := J^3$ on $L^2(S^2)$} \\
    \partial_E &:= e^{i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta + i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right) &\text{is the action of $\lbtext{E} := J^+ = J^1 + i J^2$ on $L^2(S^2)$}\\
    \partial_F &:= - \partial_E &\text{is the action of $\lbtext{F} := J^- = J^1 - i J^2$ on $L^2(S^2)$}
\end{align} where $\phi$ and $\theta$ are the azimuthal and polar angles on $S^2$, respectively.
Thus, equation \eqref{decompL2S2} is the decomposition of $L^2(S^2)$ not only as a Hilbert space, but also as a representation space of $SU(2)$.

The spinor bundle $\Sigma S^2$ of $S^2$ is trivial, so the space of \emph{spinor fields} $\hcal = L^2(S^2, \Sigma S^2)$ of $S^2$ is isomorphic (as a $C^\infty(S^2)$-module, and hence a $\CC$-vector space) to $L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2$, where $\CC^2$ is understood as the \textit{fermionic Fock space} associated to the tangent spaces of $S^2$, i.e. the unique irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra $\CC l_2 = M_2(\CC) = \pi_{1/2}(U(\sut))$. Therefore, \rtext{the space of spinor fields of $S^2$ as a representation space of $SU(2)$ decomposes as }
\begin{equation}
L^2(S^2, \Sigma S^2) \cong \bigoplus_{l = 1}^\infty V_l \otimes V_{1/2};
\end{equation} 
\ptext{we will understand from now on the separable Hilbert space $\lbtext{\hcal} = L^2(S^2)\otimes \CC^2$ as the space of spinor fields on the 2-sphere.}

\lin

This decomposition of the spinor bundle induced by the action of $SU(2)$ correctly suggests that the canonical Dirac operator $\slashed D: L^2(S^2)\otimes \CC^2 \to L^2(S^2)\otimes \CC^2$ on $S^2$ has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{equationSU2InducedSeriesDiracSlashedAndMatrix}
    \lbtext{\slashed D} =  \bigoplus_{l\in \bb N} \pi_l  \otimes \pi_{1/2}(\dcal) = 1 + \partial_F \otimes \sigma_+ + \partial_E \otimes \sigma_- + \partial_H \otimes \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \partial_H & \partial_F \\ \partial_E & 1 - \partial_H\end{pmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\pm = \sigma_1 \pm i \sigma_2$.

Using the spherical harmonics we can construct \todo{Reference} spinor fields $Y^{'}_{jm}, Y^{''}_{jm} \in \hcal$ eigenvectors of $\slashed D$, with $j \in \NN + 1/2$, $m = -j, \dots, j$, called the \textit{spinor harmonics}, which make up an orthogonal basis of $\hcal$. The eigenvalue of the $Y'_{j\cdot}$ is $(j + 1/2) \in \NN$, and for the $Y{''}_{j\cdot}$ spinor field it is $-(j + 1/2)$, hence the eigenvalue $j$ has multiplicity $2j+1$. The spectrum of $\slashed D$ (and the respective multiplicities) will be an indication of how good of an approximation is a Dirac operator on the fuzzy sphere. 

The following aiding lemma extracted from \cite{DAndrea2013} will allow us to study the spectrum of the Dirac triples that will be defined on the fuzzy sphere.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemmaSpectrumAlgebraic}
The operator $(\pi_0 \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\dcal^2): V_0 \otimes \CC^2 \to V_0 \otimes \CC^2$ has as unique eigenvalue $1$ with multiplicity $2$. For any $j \in \frac{\ZZ_{\geq 1}}{2}$, the $(\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\dcal^2)$ has two eigenvalues: $j^2$ with multiplicity $2j$, and $(j+1)^2$ with multiplicity $2j+2$.
\end{lemma}

A \lbtext{fuzzy space} is a sequence of finite dimensional $C^*$-algebras $\{\acal_N\}_{N \in \NN}$ with increasing dimension which approximate, in some sense to be determined in the specific case, a commutative $C^*$ algebra $\acal$ in the limit $N \to \infty$. When the commutative algebra encodes a topological space or a manifold with certain symmetry group $G$ that acts by homeomorphisms or diffeomorphisms, we require a fuzzy space to implement this symmetry, i.e. that $G$ acts on each $\acal_N$ by $*$-isomorphisms (the algebraic version of homeomorphisms) and in a way compatible with the derivations of $\acal$ (the algebraic version of diffeomorphisms).

With the full spectral triple defined below, the fuzzy sphere will approximate $S^2$ in the following loose ways, whose precise statements will be clear soon:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item A $C^*$-algebra acting on the Hilbert space of spinors.
    
    \item A smooth space on which $SU(2)$ acts by diffeomorphisms.
    
    \item A metric space on which $SU(2)$ acts by isometries.
    
    \end{enumerate}

\lin 

The action of $SU(2)$ on the commutative $C^*$-algebra $\acal = C(S^2)$ is the one induced by its action on $S^2$ as the double cover of the rotation group, i.e. for any $f \in C(S^2)$ and any $\vec x \in S^2$ it is given by $g\cdot f(\vec x) := f(g^{-1} \cdot \vec x)$, where $g^{-1} \cdot $ is the image of $g$ under the covering map $SU(2) \twoheadrightarrow SO(3)$. To define the fuzzy sphere $\{\acal_N\}_{N \in \NN}$ we start with the 
previously mentioned fact that any element $f \in = \acal$ is such that $\{f_N\}_{N \in \NN} \to f$ uniformly, for some sequence of polynomials $f_N \in \bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \tilde V_l$. This suggest the definition of $\lbtext{\acal'_N} := \bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \tilde V_l$, for all $N \in \NN$, as the elements of the sequence conforming the fuzzy sphere. This definition seems appropriate in at least two ways: they are unitary representation spaces of $SU(2)$, and there is a clear way in which they approximate $\acal$.

However, an obvious problem with this definition is that the representation spaces $\acal_N'$ are not closed under their natural multiplication, so they are not algebras. But, from the case $N = 1$ there is a suggestion on how to define a multiplication\cite{Madore}: requiring that the radical of the algebra is zero, there are only two possibilities, and only one being noncommutative:
\begin{align}
    x^i &\mapsto \hat x^i := \lambda \sigma_i & i = 1, 2, 3;
\end{align}
where $\lambda\in \CC$ is any constant; this means that we are defining the $N = 1$ element of the fuzzy sphere to be $\lbtext{\acal_1} := M_2(\CC)$. Having $SU(2)$ act on $\acal_1$ with the the natural representation on linear operators of representation spaces, \emph{the adjoint representation}, i.e. the action of $g \in SU(2)$ on $a \in \acal_1$ is $gag^{-1}$, notice that the identification $x^i \mapsto \hat x^i$ is $SU(2)$-equivariant since the image of $i\frac{\sigma_i}{2} \in \sut$ under the isomorphism $\sut \cong \soth$ corresponds to the generator of rotations with respect to the $x^i$-axis, and the adjoint action on these generators represents a change of rotation axis. The constant $\lambda$ is chosen such that ``radius of the fuzzy sphere is $1$'', meaning that $(\hat x^1)^2 + (\hat x^2)^2 + (\hat  x^3)^2 = 1$, hence $\lambda = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{2} + 1)}}$.

Instead of insisting on defining a foreign multiplication in $\acal'_N$, the fuzzy sphere is now defined by from the following generalization of the $N = 1$ case studied above:
\begin{definition}\label{definitionFuzzySphere}
\emph{The fuzzy sphere} is defined as the sequence of $C^*$-algebras $\{\acal_N\}_{N \in \NN}$ where $\acal_N := \pi_j(U(\sut)) \equiv End(V_j)$ where $N =: 2j$ and with $\pi_j$ as defined in Notation \ref{notRepSu2}. In addition, define the algebra generators $\hat x^i$ as
\begin{align}\label{equationDefinitionGeneratorsFuzzySphere}
    \hat x^i := \frac{1}{\sqrt{j(j+1)}} \pi_{j}(J^i) && i = 1, 2, 3;
\end{align}
the number $\lambda_N := \frac{1}{\sqrt{j(j+1)}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{N(N+2)}}$ is called \emph{the normalization factor}. The algebra generators $\hat x^i$ of each $\acal_N$ will be usually referred to as \emph{the fuzzy coordinates}.
\end{definition}

The normalization factor $\lambda_N$ is such that $(\hat x^1)^2 + (\hat x^2)^2 + (\hat x^3)^2 = 1$. The elements $\hat x^i \in \acal_N$, $i = 1, 2, 3$ generate the algebra; furthermore, each element in $a \in \acal_N$ has a unique expansion $a = \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \hat x^{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots \hat x^{a_{l}}$, where $a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \in \CC$ is symmetric and trace-free as a tensor \cite{Madore}\todo{Not sure how to prove these two statements. Not even sure what the trace might mean if there are not even number of components. If $N=1$ it is easy to see that indeed ever $2x2$ matrix is combination of $1$ and Pauli}.  Thus, the following is an injective, but also $SO(3)$-equivariant linear map:
\begin{eqnsplit}\label{}
    \acal_N &\to C(S^2)\\% = \bigoplus_{l \in \NN}\tilde V_l\\
    \hat x^i &\mapsto x^i;
\end{eqnsplit}
its equivariance is carefully proven in Proposition \ref{propositionMadoreISSO3Covariant}. We might say that \emph{$\hat x^i$ is the fuzzy analog of the coordinate function $x^i$}, and so we obtain in general the \rtext{nonzero commutation relation of the \emph{fuzzy coordinates}}:
\begin{align}\label{}
    [\hat x^i, \hat x^j] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{j(j+1)}} i \epsilon_{ijk} \hat x^k, && i, j, k \in \{1, 2, 3\},
\end{align} where the Einstein summation convention for implicit sums of repeated indices is understood, and where $\epsilon_{ijk}$ denotes the Levi-Civita tensor.

In order to gain some intuition for the fuzzy sphere, recall that the operator representation of $J^i$ in each $V_j$ and in $L^2(S^2)$ is as the $i$-th component of the angular momentum operator, in the corresponding quantum theory. Another interpretation, at least for even-indexed elements of the sequence, comes from the fact that the Lie algebra $\sut$ is isomorphic to $\soth \subset M_3(\CC)$ under the $(SU(2), SO(3))$-equivariant mapping $iJ^i \mapsto i \hat J^i$, where $i \hat J^i$ is the generator of rotation in $\RR^3$ about the $i$-th axis; hence, the fuzzy analog of the coordinate function $x^i \in C(S^2)$ is an element proportional to the infinitesimal rotation with respect to the $i$-th axis. 

\lin

This \textit{fuzzy} version of the sphere is, so far, good in two of the three ways stated at the beginning of this subsection:

\subsubsection{$SU(2)$ acts by diffeomorphisms}

From the $SU(2)$-equivariance of the identifications $x^i \to \hat x^i$, we see that $\acal_N \cong \acal'_N \cong \bigoplus_{l=0}^N V_l$ as representation spaces of $SU(2)$, where the action of $g \in SU(2)$ is the adjoint action on $\acal_N$ seen as $End(V_j)$, namely by the inner automorphism $B  \mapsto \pi_j(g)B \pi_j(g)^{-1}$, where $\pi_j(g) \in SU(N+1)$ since $\pi_j$ is an unitary representation. That $(\pi_j(g)B \pi_j(g)^{-1})^* = \pi_j(g)B^* \pi_j(g)^{-1}$, where $B^*$ is the adjoint of $B \in M_{N+1}(\CC)$, shows that \rtext{$SU(2)$ acts by $*$-automorphisms on $\acal_N$}.

A diffeomorphism of $S^2$ is equivalent to an automorphism of the algebra $C^\infty(S^2)$ (dense subalgebra of $\acal$) that respects the complex conjugation $*$, thus giving us an alternative algebraic definition of a diffeomorphism. In the matrix algebras $M_{N+1}(\CC)$, since they are simple, all $*$-automorphisms are precisely of the form $B \mapsto C B C^{-1}$ for some $C \in SU(N+1)$. Furthermore, all such automorphisms also respect the derivations of $\acal_N$, which are the algebraic analogues of vector fields. Hence, all $*$-automorphisms of $\acal_N$ are good analogues of diffeomorphisms of $S^2$, and so we may say that \rtext{$SU(2)$ {is acting by diffeomorphisms on the fuzzy sphere}}.

\subsubsection{As $C^*$-algebra acting on spinors}

Replacing the coordinates $x^i$ by $\hat x^i$  in the (symmetric) polynomial expansion of the spherical harmonics $Y^l_m$, $l = 0, \dots, N$ and $|m| \leq l$, we obtain the \lbtext{fuzzy harmonics} $\hat Y^l_m \in \acal_N$ that make up a basis of $\acal_N$.

Define the linear, injective mapping
\begin{eqnsplit}
    \acal_N &\to \acal'_N \subset \acal \\
    \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \hat x^{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots \hat x^{a_{l}} &\mapsto \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} x^{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots x^{a_{l}}.
\end{eqnsplit}
Then, the sequence of noncommutative $C^*$-algebras approximates the commutative algebra $A = C(S^2)$ in the limit $N \to \infty$ in the sense that the above map gets increasingly closer to being an algebra morphism and \textbf{the algebra $A$ can be considered as the image of the \textit{near-diagonal matrices} in $\acal_N$} i.e. matrices which commute within order $1$ of the normalizing factor $\lambda_N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{j(j+1)}}$; the details may be found in \cite{Madore}.


Finally, we are yet to see how the fuzzy sphere approximates $S^2$ as metric space on which $SU(2)$ acts by isometries, but this will be consequences of Theorem \ref{theoremReducibleSpectralTripleDiracApproximation} and the Remark that follows.

\section{Spectral Triples}
\label{CHFSSectionSpectralTriples}
% {\color{gray} --  Truncate the $SU(2)$-equivariant \textbf{decomposition} of the canonical spectral triple}

The introduction of a spectral triple on each unital algebra $\acal_N$ that make up the fuzzy sphere will introduce the notion of distance between states of the algebra, opening the door to the study of geometry on this spaces. Furthermore, we would like to introduce a spectral triple that somehow allows us to think of the fuzzy sphere as an approximation of $S^2$ also as metric spaces. 

In this document, this will occur in the following senses:

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The spectrum (and the multiplicities of the eigenvalues) of the Dirac operator approximates that of $\slashed D$ as $N$ increases
    
    \item To each point in $S^2$ there is a corresponding pure state on each $\acal_N$, and the distance between the coherent states corresponding to two points in $S^2$ tends to the commutative distance between the points as $N \to \infty$.
    
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{$SU(2)$-equivariance}

% {\color{gray}
% Presentation:

% $SU(2) \ni g$ acts on the states: $\lbtext{g_*\omega}(\cdot) := \omega(\cdot^g)$ $\longleftarrow$ it acts on the algebra: $\lbtext{a^g}:= g\circ a \circ g^* \cdot$ $\longleftarrow$ it acts on $V_j$: $\pi_j(g)$.

% \textbf{\rtext{Theorem}}: For all $N = 2j \in \bb N$, the distance is $SU(2)$-invariant: 
% \begin{align}
%     d_N(\omega, \omega') &= d_N(g_* \omega, g_*\omega'), & \text{for all $\omega, \omega' \in \mathcal S(\acal_N)$}.
% \end{align}

% \textit{Pf}: The theorem follows once we show 
%     \rtext{$||[D_N, a^g]|| = ||[D_N, a]||$}:
% $d_N(g_* \omega, g_* \omega') = sup_{a \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(a^g) - \omega'(a^g)|: ||[D_N, a \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} = sup_{b \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(b) - \omega'(b)|: ||[D_N, b \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} = d_N(\omega, \omega')$, where $b = a^g$ sweeps all $\acal_N$.

% \textit{Pf}: $[D_N, a^g \otimes 1] = u[D_N, a \otimes 1_2]u^*$ where $u = \pi_j(g) \otimes \pi_{1/2}(g)$ is the induced unitary action of $g$ in $H_N$ $\xleftarrow{}$
% 1. $a^g \otimes 1_2 = u(a \otimes 1_2)u^*$;
% 2. The spectral triple is $SU(2)$-equivariant, hence $D_N$ commutes with the $SU(2)$ action.
% }

Rotating the 2-sphere leaves invariant not only its topological and differential properties, but it also leaves invariant the metric, $g = d\theta^2 + \sin^2(\theta) d\phi^2$, implying that the distance between any $2$ points is the same as the distance between the rotated points, under any rotation $h \in SO(3)$. Since $SU(2)$ is the double covering of $SO(3)$, there is a $2$-to-$1$ Lie group morphism $SU(2) \to SO(3)$ under which any rotation $h \in SO(3)$ corresponds to two distinct points $\pm \tilde h \in SU(2)$. From this it follows that each element of $SU(2)$ acts as a rotation on $S^2$, so that \rtext{$SU(2)$ is also a group of symmetries of $S^2$ that acts by diffeomorphisms and isometries}. Notice, however, that the most general symmetry group of $S^2$ is the orthogonal group $O(3)$, which includes reflections under planes on $\RR^3$ that pass through the origin.

One important property of the spectral triples that will be defined on the fuzzy sphere is their equivariance under $SU(2)$, or more generally the Hopf algebra $U(\sut)$ as defined in \cite{Sitarz}, giving an analogous notion to the action of these symmetry spaces by isometries. The precise definition of a \textit{spectral triple $(\acal, \hcal, \dcal)$ equivariant under a symmetry space $H$}, $H$ being called \textit{the isometry of the spectral triple}, is fairly involved, but, ignoring some details, reduces to the following:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item $\acal$ is a representation of $H$.
    
    \item $\hcal $ is a representation of $H$.
    
    \item The action of $H$ on $\acal$ coincides with the action $\acal$ as subalgebra of operators on $H$, i.e. the adjoint action $A \mapsto g \circ A \circ g^{-1}$. %there is a dense subspace $V$ of $\hcal$ on which the action induced on operators
    
    \item The \textit{Dirac operator is equivariant}, i.e. the operator $[\dcal, h] = 0$ for all $h \in H$.
    
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{For the spectral triples defined in this section, the $SU(2)$-equivariance reduces to the verification of the last two conditions}, since the first two ones are readily satisfied. The following theorem, which will apply to all the spectral triples defined in this chapter, illustrates how this notion of equivariance induces a notion of isometry on the respective noncommutative spaces.

\begin{theorem} \label{theoGInvariantDistance}
Let $(\acal, \hcal, \dcal)$ be a spectral triple. Let $G$ be a group, let $\hcal$ and $\acal$ be representation spaces of $G$, with $G$ acting unitarily on $H$. Then, if for all $g \in G$, $[D, g\cdot] = 0$ and the action on $A$ coincides / interwines with the induced action on $A$ as subalgebra of operators on $H$, then $SU(2)$ acts by isometries on the state space $\mathcal S(\acal)$. That is, for all $g \in G$:
\begin{align}
    d_\dcal(\omega, \omega') &= d_\dcal(g_* \omega, g_*\omega'), & \text{for all $\omega, \omega' \in \mathcal S(\acal)$};
\end{align}
we have denoted by $g^*\omega$ the action of $G$ on $\mathcal S(\acal)$, $g^* \omega: \acal \to \CC$, $a \mapsto \omega(a^g)$, induced from the action $a \mapsto a^g$ of $G$ on $\acal$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The theorem follows once we show that 
\begin{equation}\label{normEqualDiracAction}
    ||[\dcal, a^g]|| = ||[\dcal, a]||,
\end{equation} since, in that case,
\begin{align*}
d_\dcal(g_* \omega, g_* \omega') &= sup_{a \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(a^g) - \omega'(a^g)|: ||[\dcal, a \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} \\
    &= sup_{b \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(b) - \omega'(b)|: ||[\dcal, b \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} \\
    &= d_\dcal(\omega, \omega'),
\end{align*}
since $b = a^g$, for fixed $g \in SU(2)$, sweeps all $\acal_N$ if $a$ does.

Now, denoting the action of $G \ni g$ on $\hcal$ by $g \cdot$:
\begin{align*}
    (g \cdot) \circ [\dcal, a]\circ (g\cdot )^* &= (g \cdot) \circ [\dcal, a]\circ (g^{-1}\cdot )\\
        &= (g \cdot) \circ \dcal \circ a \circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) - (g \cdot) \circ a \circ  \dcal \circ (g^{-1}\cdot )\\
        &= \dcal (g \cdot) \circ a\circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) - (g \cdot) \circ a\circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) \dcal  \\
        &= \dcal \circ a^g - a^g \circ \dcal\\
        & = [\dcal, a^g];
\end{align*} 
the third equality follows from the commutation of $\dcal$ with $g\cdot$, and the fourth one from the fact that the actions of $g$ and $\acal$ interwine. The desired equality \eqref{normEqualDiracAction} follows from this calculation, and from the unitarity of the operators $(g \cdot)$ and $(g\cdot)^*$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Irreducible Spectral Triple}
 
% {\color{gray} - One term of the canonical spectral triple
 
% Presentation:

% A first spectral triple is simply taking ``one term'' of $\slashed D$:
% \begin{multline}
%     \lbtext{D_N} 
%     := (\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D): V_j \otimes \CC^2 \to V_j \otimes \CC^2 \\
%     = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \pi_j(H) & \pi_j(F) \\ \pi_j(E) & 1 - \pi_j(H)\end{pmatrix} 
%     = 1 + \pi_j(F) \otimes \sigma_+ + \pi_j(E) \otimes \sigma_- + \pi_j(H) \otimes \sigma_3
% \end{multline} where $H = J^3$, $F = J^+$, $E = J^-$ are the actions of $J^3$, $J^\pm \in su(2)$ on $V_j$ respectively.

% - The spectral triple \rtext{$(\acal_N, \lbtext{H_N} = V_j \otimes \CC^2, D_N)$}
%     \begin{itemize}
        
%     \item Is $SU(2)$-equivariant
    
%     \item Has eigenvalues $j+1$ and $-j$ with multiplicities $2j+2$ and $2j$.
        
%     \item Isn't compatible with a grading or a real structure.
%     \end{itemize}
% }    

This spectral triple, although unsatisfactory as an approximation of the canonical spectral triple of $S^2$ with respect to the first criteria stated at the beginning of the section, will turn out to be very useful for computations.

\begin{definition}
For each $N \in \NN$ and $j = N/2$, define the \lbtext{irreducible spectral triple} as $(\acal_N, \lbtext{H_N} := V_j \otimes \CC^2, D_N = (\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D))$, where $\acal_N = End(V_j)$ acts naturally on the first factor of $H_N$.
\end{definition}

This spectral triple may be seen to come as a single term of the $SU(2)$-induced expansion of $\slashed D$ \eqref{equationSU2InducedSeriesDiracSlashedAndMatrix}, although we are also allowing  half integer spin representations in the current construction, which don't appear in the expansion of $\slashed \dcal$. The Dirac operators can also be written as
\begin{equation}
    D_N = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \pi_j(H) & \pi_j(F) \\ \pi_j(E) & 1 - \pi_j(H)\end{pmatrix} 
    = 1 + \pi_j(F) \otimes \sigma_+ + \pi_j(E) \otimes \sigma_- + \pi_j(H) \otimes \sigma_3
\end{equation}
where $H = J^3$, $F = J^+$, $E = J^-$ are the respective actions of $J^3$, $J^+, J^- \in U(\sut)$ on $V_j$.

We have said before that this spectral triple is $SU(2)$-equivariant, but for this to make sense in the first place we need to define an action of $SU(2)$ on $\acal_N$ and $H_N$, both of which will be inherited from the untitary representation $\pi_j$ of $SU(2)$ on $V_j$. Since $\acal_N = End(V_j)$, the action of each $SU(2) \ni g$ induces the adjoint action on its operators, also called an action by \emph{inner automorphisms}:
\begin{equation}
    a \mapsto \lbtext{a^g} := \pi_j(g) a \pi_j(g)^*.
\end{equation} 
Similarly, on $H_N = V_j \otimes V_{1/2}$ we may define the unitary left action of $g \in SU(2)$ by $u_g := \pi_j(g) \otimes \pi_{1/2}(g) \in \mathcal B(H_n)$; notice that, when $j \in \NN$, this representation is one of the terms of the decomposition of the representation of $\hcal = L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2$ into representations of $SU(2)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{propIrredSpectralTriple}
For each $N \in \NN$, the associated irreducible spectral triple:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        
    \item Is $SU(2)$-equivariant
    
    \item Has eigenvalues $j+1$ and $-j$ with multiplicities $2j+2$ and $2j$, where $j = N/2$.
        
    \item Isn't compatible with a grading or a real structure.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
As stated at the beginning of the section, to proof the $SU(2)$-equivariance follows from $[D_N, u_g] = 0$ and $u_g  a  u_g^* \equiv u_g \circ (a \otimes 1) \circ u_g^* = a^g \otimes 1 \equiv a_g$.

That those are the eigenvalues and their multiplicities follows from finding eigenvectors 
\begin{align}\label{irreducibleDiracFuzzySpinorBasis}
    |j, m \kket_+ := 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    \sqrt{\frac{j+m+1}{2j+1}} |j, m\rangle \\ 
    \sqrt{\frac{j-m}{2j+1}} |j, m+1 \rangle
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    |j, m\kket_- := 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    -\sqrt{\frac{j-m}{2j+1}} |j, m\rangle \\ 
    \sqrt{\frac{j+m+1}{2j+1}} |j, m+1 \rangle
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
for $|m| \leq j$ with the mentioned eigenvectors, and deducing that there are no more eigenvectors thanks to the lemma \ref{lemmaSpectrumAlgebraic}.

If the spectral triple had a grading, the Dirac operator would have a symmetric spectrum about $0$, hence this can't be the case.

That a real structure $J_N: H_N \to H_N$ doesn't exist doesn't exist follows from the fact that the commutant of $\acal_N$ is $2$, and so it can't contained $J \acal_N J^{-1}$.

\end{proof}

% \begin{multline}
%     \lbtext{\mathcal D_N} := (\textbf{ad}\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D) = D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \text{ad}\pi_j(H) & \text{ad}\pi_j(F) \\ \text{ad}\pi_j(E) & 1 - \text{ad}\pi_j(H)\end{pmatrix}

% where, e.g. $\text{ad}\pi_j(H) = [\pi_J(H), \cdot ]$ is the action of $J^3 \in su(2)$ on $\mathcal A_N$.

% - \rtext{\textbf{Theorem}}: the two spectral triples induce the same distance in $\acal_N$. Pf: $[\dcal, a]b \otimes v = \cdots = \sum_k [\pi_j(J^k), a]b \otimes \sigma_k v = [D_N, a] \cdot b \otimes v$
% }


\begin{definition}
For each $N \in \NN$, $j = N/2$, the \lbtext{full spectral triple} is $(\acal_N, \lbtext{\hcal_N} := \mathcal A_N \otimes \CC^2, \lbtext{\mathcal D_N} := (\text{ad}\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D) )$, where $a \in \acal_N$ acts on the first factor of $\hcal_N$ via the commutator $[a, \cdot]$.
\end{definition}

Notice that the action of $\acal_N$ on itself as the first factor of $\hcal_N$ is simply the derivative of the adjoint action $B \mapsto \pi_j(g) B \pi_j(g)^{-1}$ of $SU(2) \ni g$ on $\acal_N = End(V_j)$. This action extends to an action $\text{ad}\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2}$ on $\hcal_N = \acal_N \otimes V_{1/2}$. Under the $SU(2)$-induced decomposition of $\acal_N$ into irreducible representations, the Hilbert space $\hcal_N$ is isomorphic to $\bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l$, where the representation $\text{ad}\pi_j$ on one side then corresponds to the representation $\bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \pi_l$ on the other side, in which case the Dirac operator $\dcal_N$ corresponds to:
\begin{equation}\label{reducibleDiracDecomposition}
    \mathcal D_N : \hcal_N \to \hcal_N  \iff \bigoplus_{l =1}^N D_l: \bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l \to \bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}\label{theoremReducibleSpectralTripleDiracApproximation}
Under the adjoint action of $SU(2)$ on the algebra $\acal_N$ and the action of $SU(2)$ defined in the previous paragraph, the full spectral triples satisfies:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    
    \item It is $SU(2)$-equivariant.
    
    \item It is a real spectral triple, with real structure $\mathcal J_N: \hcal_N \to \hcal_N$, $a \otimes v \mapsto a^* \otimes \sigma_2 \cut v$.
    
    \item The spectrum of $\mathcal D_N$ is the truncation of $\slashed D$ to $\{-N, \dots, N+1\}$, ie. the eigenvalues of $\mathcal D_N$ are $N+1$ with multiplicity $2N+2$, and $\pm l$ with multiplicity $2l$ for $l = 1, \dots, N$.
    
    \item It is not compatible with a grading.
    
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
It is straightforward to verify that: $\mathcal J_N$ is antilinear and antiunitary, $\mathcal J_N^2 = - 1$, $\mathcal J_N (\acal_N \mathcal\otimes 1) J_N^{-1} \subset (\acal_N \mathcal\otimes 1)' \subset \bcal(\hcal_N)$ (the $\acal '$ denotes the algebra that commutes with the algebra $\acal \subset \bcal(\hcal_N)$), and $\mathcal J_N \dcal_N = \dcal_N \mathcal J_N$; hence $\mathcal J_N$ is a real structure.

From the $SU(2)$-decomposition \eqref{reducibleDiracDecomposition} of the Dirac operator, results (ii) and (iii) follow from the application of proposition \ref{reducibleDiracDecomposition} to each of the terms.

Once again, a grading can't exist since the spectrum of $\dcal_N$ isn't symmetric.
\end{proof}

\rtext{The third statement of the theorems says that we have found a spectral triple with the desired property of being a truncation of the canonical spectral triple of $S^2$}. { \color{gray}
%Furthermore, just like the eigenvectors of $\slashed D$ are vectors conformed by pairs of spherical harmonics, the eigenvectors of each $\dcal_N$ are pairs of fuzzy spherical harmonics $\hat Y^l_m$ (not sure if they can be the ones I defined before) for which the traditional spherical harmonics $Y^l_m$ may be considered ``symbols''.
} Hence, this will be the spectral triple which we will assign the forming algebras of the fuzzy sphere, under which the metric properties are to be studied, since it \rtext{may be considered a sequence of spectral triple that approximate the metric of $S^2$ increasingly better with growing $N$}. However, the following theorem allows us to study instead the much simpler irreducible spectral triple.

\begin{theorem}\label{theoremIrreducibleAndFUllSpectralTripleSameDistance}
The irreducible and full spectral triple on $\acal_N$, for each $N \in \NN$, induce the same distance in the state space of $\acal_N$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\omega, \omega'$ be states on $\acal_N$. Notice that distinct spectral triples induce different notions of distance only due to the condition $||[D, a]|| \leq 1$, which determines over which elements $a$ of the algebra the supremum of $|\omega(a) - \omega'(a)|$ is evaluated. However, for all $a \in \acal$, $||[\dcal_N, a]|| = ||[D_N, a]||$ as shown by the following calculation:
\begin{align*}
    [\dcal, a]b \otimes v &= \dcal_N(ab \otimes v) - a\left(b \otimes v + \sum_{k = 1}^3 [\pi_j(J^k), b] \otimes \sigma_k v\right)\\
        &= ab \otimes v + \sum_{k = 1}^3[\pi_j(J^k), ab] \otimes \sigma_k v - ab \otimes v - \sum_{k = 1}^3 a[\pi_j(J^k), b]\otimes \sigma_k v\\
        &= \sum_k [\pi_j(J^k), a]b \otimes \sigma_k v\\
        &= [1_{N+1} \otimes 1_2 + \sum_{k = 1}^3 \pi_j(J^k)\otimes \sigma_k, a](b, v)\\
        &= [D_N, a] \cdot b \otimes v.
\end{align*}
This tells us that $[\slashed D_N, a]: \hcal_N \to \hcal_N$ is the operator of left multiplication by the matrix $[D_N, a] \in \acal_N \otimes M_2(\CC)$, implying that its operator norm coincides with the norm of the matrix $[D_N, a]$.
\end{proof}

% - \dbtext{Are they pure}? They are vector states, I think that suffices to make them pure.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General Theory}

We now define the Bloch spin coherent states, also called or $SU(2)$-coherent states in each $\acal_N$ of the fuzzy sphere. Given $N \in \NN$, each coherent state is labeled by a point in $S^2 = SU(2) / S^1$, allowing us to interpret each coherent state as a ``fuzzy approximation'' of a point in $S^2$. Furtheremore, the ``fuzzyness'' of this approximation decreases as $N \to \infty$ since theorem \ref{theoremdNWithRespectoTodS2} shows that the distance between coherent states corresponding to two points in $S^2$ tends to the respective distance in $S^2$.

In quantum mechanics, coherent states were first introduced for the quantum version of the simple harmonic oscillator, as minimum uncertainty states for position and momentum, making them states whose time evolution is the closest to that of the corresponding classical evolution. Since then, many generalizations have emerged, using mainly one of the following properties of the system of coherent states $\{|\alpha\rangle\}_{\CC}$ of the simple harmonic oscillator:
    \begin{enumerate}
        
    \item Each $|\alpha\rangle$ saturates the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
    
    \item Each $|\alpha\rangle$ are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, with eigenvalue $\alpha \in \CC$
    
    \item $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ is generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group acting on the vacuum $|0\rangle$
        
    \end{enumerate}
Particularly Perolomov \cite{Perelomov} defines systems of coherent states using $(3)$ for various Lie groups $G$ acting irreducibly and unitarily on a Hilbert space $\hcal$ through a representation $T$, once a vector $\phi_0$ has been chosen. Then the set of coherent states is defined as the set of vectors in $\hcal$ 
\begin{equation}
    \{ T, \phi_0\} := \{\phi_g := T(g) \phi_0 \,:\, g \in G\}.
\end{equation}
These vectors are labeled by the topological and measure space $X := G/H$ where $H$ is \emph{the isotropy subgroup for $|0\rangle$}, i.e. the subgroup $H \ni h$ composed of elements such that
\begin{equation*}
    \phi_h = \exp{[i \alpha(h)]}\phi_0,
\end{equation*}
for some function $\alpha : H \to \RR$, i.e. $H$ simply generate a change of phase on $\phi_0$, which also means that $\phi_g$ and $\phi_{gh}$ are in the same ray for all $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. This, in particular, means that the projection into the $1$-dimensional subspace generated by $\phi_g$, $P_{\phi_g}$, coincides with $P_{\phi_{gh}}$, and so these projections can also be labeled by $X$. This procedure produces a system coherent states under one of the following definitions:

\begin{definition}\label{definitionSystemCoherentStates}
Let $\hcal$ be a Hilbert space. A set $\{\phi_x\}_{x \in \Omega} \subset \hcal$ indexed by a topological space $\Omega$ is called a \emph{strong system of coherent states} if it satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Continuity: the mapping $x \mapsto \phi_x$ is strongly continuous.
    
    \item Resolution of the identity: there exists on $\Omega$ an integration measure $dx$ such that
    \begin{align}
        1_{\hcal} = \int_{\Omega} P_x \,dx, && P_x = |\phi_x \rangle \langle \phi_x |.
     \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
If instead the set $\{\phi_x\}_{x \in \Omega}$ property ($1$) and 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[2'.] Completeness: $\overline{\text{Span}\{\phi_x \,:\, x \in \Omega\}} = \hcal$,
\end{enumerate}
it is called a \emph{weak system of coherent states}.
\end{definition}

The set $\{T, \phi_g\}$ is then a weak system of coherent states indexed by $G$ since $T$ is an irreducible representation. Similarly, a set $\{\phi_{g(x)}\}_{x \in X}$ for which $g(x)$ is a section of the principal bundle $H \to G \to G/H$ is also a weak system of coherent states.

\lin

The weak systems that we just saw are, under some conditions, also strong systems of coherent states. Since $G$ is a Lie group it has a left invariant Haar measure, and this induces an invariant (under $G$) measure in $X = G/H$. Now, the generating vector $\phi_0$ is called \emph{admissible} if $I_T = \int_{X} |\langle \phi_0|T[g(x)] |\phi_0\rangle|^2 dx$ is finite; this is automatically true if $G$ or $G/H$ are compact. If $\phi_0$ is admissible, then the operator $B := \int_X P_x dx : \hcal \to \hcal$ is convergent. Since, if $x' = g'x$ for some $g'$ implies that $T(g') P_x T(g'^{-1}) = P_{x'}$, then the invariance of $dx$ implies that $T(g') BT(g'^{-1}) = B$, i.e. $B$ is central. Since the representation on $\hcal$ is univary, Schurl's lemma then tells us that $B = b I_\hcal$ for some constant $b$. The value of $b$ can be determined to be $b = \frac{I_T}{\langle \phi_0, \phi_0 \rangle}$, and this induces a normalized integration measure $d\mu(x) = dx/b$ and hence
\begin{align}
    1_\hcal = B/b = \int_X P_x d\mu(x),
\end{align}
implying that $\{\phi_x\}_{x \in X}$ is a strong system of coherent states labeled by $X = G/H$.
If $H$ has finite volume $h$, then it is also true that
\begin{align}
    1_\hcal = \int_G P_{\phi_g} d\mu'(g),
\end{align}
where $d\mu'(g) = d\mu(g)/bh$, where $d\mu$ is the Haar measure of $G$; under this condition, $\{\phi_g\}_{g \in G}$ is a strong system of coherent states labeled by $G$ itself.

% }

So far, the systems of coherent states derived from the procedure previously followed only generalize property $(3)$. However, when we apply the procedure to $G = SU(2)$ we can obtain a system of coherent states that generalize also property ($1$), and they are called the \emph{spin coherent states} or \emph{Bloch coherent states} of \emph{$SU(2)$-coherent states}. Let $\hcal = V_j$ be, as usual, the unitary irreducible representation space of $SU(2)$ of spin $j$, and suppose that $\phi_0$ maximizes the (dimension of the) Lie algebra $\alg h$ of the isotropry group $H$ within the complexification $\alg g_\CC - \alg{sl}(2, \CC)$ of the Lie algebra $\sut$ of $G = SU(2)$, and also that $\phi_0$ minimizes the $SU(2)$-invariant square dispersion $(\Delta \vec L)^2$; this is satisfied by both $|j, j\rangle$ and $|j, -j\rangle$, since their isotropy group is $H = \{e^{iJ^3 \alpha} \, : \, \alpha \in \RR\} \cong SO(2)$ hax maximal isotropy algebra in $\alg{sl}(2, \CC)$, and they both satisfy 
\begin{equation}
    (\Delta \vec L)^2 = (\Delta \vec L)^2_{min} = \langle \vec L^2 \rangle - \langle \vec L \rangle ^2 = l(l+1) - l^2 = l.
\end{equation}

We then see that there is system of coherent states labeled by the space
\begin{equation}
    S^1 \cong SU(2) / SO(2);
\end{equation}
furthermore, since $SU(2) \cong S^3$ is compact, \textit{this system of coherent states is strong}. We may obtain these by specifying rotations $R_{\phi, \theta} \in SO(3)$ given an arbitrary point $E(\phi, \theta)$ in $S^2$, and applying them to one of $|j, j \rangle$ or $|j, -j\rangle$. Following \cite{Arecchi}, we choose the rotation about the axis $\hat n = (\sin \phi, -\cos \phi, 0)$ of an angle $\theta$.

Getting rid of the sign ambiguity in even dimensional representation spaces:
\begin{definition}\label{definitionCoherentStatesSU2}
The \emph{SU(2)}-coherent states in $V_j$ are defined as the application of
\begin{equation}
    R_{\phi, \theta} := e^{-i\theta(J^1 \sin \phi - J^2 \cos \phi)} = e^{\zeta J^+ - \zeta^* J^-} \in SU(2),
\end{equation}
where $\zeta = \frac{1}{2}\theta e^{-i\phi}$, to the vector $|j, -j\rangle$ that minimizes the $SU(2)$-invariant dispersion $(\Delta \vec L)^2$ and maximizes the isotropy subalgebra within $\alg{sl}(2, \CC)$ under the action of $SU(2)$. They have the formulas:
\begin{eqnsplit}\label{equationCOherentRotation}
    |\phi, \theta )_N &:= R_{\phi, \theta} |j, -j\rangle \\
    &= \sum_{m = -j}^j \binom{2j}{j+1}^{\frac{1}{2}} e^{-im\phi} (\sin \frac{\theta}{2})^{j+m} (\cos \theta)^{j-m} |j, m\rangle.
\end{eqnsplit}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $N = 2j \in \NN$. For each $E(\phi, \theta)$ in $S^2$ define
\begin{equation*}
    \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} := (\phi, \theta, | \, \cdot \, | \phi, \theta)_N \in \mathcal S(\acal_N),
\end{equation*}
i.e. as the vector state associated to the coherent state $|\phi, \theta)_N$. We will also call these \emph{the $SU(2)$-coherent states}, etc.
\end{definition}

We have said that we want to identify the coherent states as fuzzy approximations of points in $S^2$. A first step was made by the fact that the coherent states are labeled by $SU(2)$. Furthermore, this identification is $SU(2)$-equivariant, i.e. for any $g \in SU(2)$, 
\begin{equation}
    g_* \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^N_{g\cdot (\phi, \theta)}
\end{equation}
for all $E(\phi, \theta) \in S^2$. This is expressed at the Lie algebra level by the following:
\begin{proposition}
For all $E(\phi, \theta) \in S^2$ and any $a \in \acal_N$, for arbitrary $N \in \NN$
\begin{eqnsplit}
    \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} ([H, a]) = -i \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} (a),\\
    \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} ([E, a]) = e^{i \phi} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} + i \cot \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial_\phi} \right) \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} (a),\\
    \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} ([F, a]) = -e^{-i\phi} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} - i \cot \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial_\phi} \right) \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} (a).
\end{eqnsplit}
\end{proposition}

% \textit{From now on}: we use the irreducible s.t. and not write the $\pi_j$'s.

% - The supremum $d_}(\omega, \omega')$ is always attained in hermitian elements.

% - For $a \in \acal_N$, 
% \begin{equation} \label{ineqDN}
%     ||[H, a]||, ||[E, a]||, ||[F, a]||  \leq ||[D_N, a]||;

% if $a$ is diagonal hermitian, then
% \begin{equation}
%     ||[E, a]|| = ||[D_N, a]||.
% \end{equation}

% - A state may be defined only on hermitian elements of $\acal$, since from there it can be uniquely extended to all $\acal$: $a = \frac{a+a^*}{2} + \frac{a - a^*}{2} \in Herm. + Antiherm. = Herm. + i\, Herm.$

% }

Due to theorem \ref{theoremIrreducibleAndFUllSpectralTripleSameDistance}, although the full spectral triple seems to be a better approximation of the canonical spectral triple due to the properties of the spectrum of $\dcal_N$, for $N$ any natural number, it suffices to study the distances using the irreducible spectral triple since it induces exactly the same notion of distance on each $\acal_N$. From now on we will stop writing the symbols $\pi_j$, $j = N/2$, denoting the unitary representation of $U(\sut) \ni H = J^3, E = J^-, F = J^+$ on $V_j$ unless confusion may arise; hence we will write the Dirac operator as
\begin{equation}
    D_N = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + H & F \\ E & 1 - H\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Notice that, under this matrix notation that follows from the tensor product with the Pauli matrices, an algebra element $a \in \acal$ corresponds to the matrix
\begin{equation}\label{aAsMatrixOperator}
    a = \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} as an operator on $H_N$.

\begin{remark}
If $\acal$ is a unital $C^*$-algebra, and $D$ is an associated Dirac operator, the supremum  $d_\dcal(\omega, \omega')$, of $|\omega(a) - \omega'(a)|$ for $a \in \acal$ such that $||[D, a]|| \leq 1$, is always attained in hermitian $(a = a^*)$ elements \cite{Iochum2001}, hence Connes' distant formula for a spectral triple $(\acal, \hcal, \dcal)$ can be changed to
\begin{equation} \label{distanceFormulaHermitian}
    d_\dcal(\omega, \omega') = sup_{a \in \acal, \,a = a^*} \{|\omega(a) - \omega'(a)| : ||[\dcal, a\|| \leq 1\}.
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A state may be defined from its action on hermitian elements of the $C^*$-algebra $\acal$, since from there it can be uniquely extended to all of $\acal$, since any $a \in \acal$ can be written as $a = \frac{a+a^*}{2} + i \frac{a - a^*}{2i}$, where $\frac{a+a^*}{2}$ and $\frac{a-a^*}{2i}$ are hermitian.
\end{remark}

The following lemma will also be a very helpful tool for our following  studies, and its proof exemplifies how the norm of the commutator $||[D, a]||$ appearing in the definition of Connes' distance, may be studied.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemmaRelationOperatorsAndDirac}
For any $a \in \acal_N$, the following inequalities about operators on $H_N$ are satisfied:
\begin{equation} \label{ineqDN}
    ||[H, a]||, ||[E, a]||, ||[F, a]||  \leq ||[D_N, a]||;
\end{equation} \label{eqDNdiag}
if $a$ is diagonal and hermitian, then
\begin{equation}
    ||[D_N, a]|| = ||[E, a]|| = ||[F, a]||.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $a \in \acal_N$ be arbitrary. Then
\begin{align*}
    ||[D_N, a]||^2 
        &= sup_{v \in H_N, |v| = 1} |[D_N, a] | v \rangle|^2 \\
        &= sup_{v \in H_N, |v| = 1} \langle v | [D_N, a]^* [D_N, a] | v \rangle.
\end{align*}

To find a lower bound for the norm of $[D_N, a]$, first notice that 
\begin{align*}
    [D_N, a] &= \begin{pmatrix} [H, a] & [F, a] \\ [E, a] & -[H, a] \end{pmatrix}&
    [D_N, a]^* = \begin{pmatrix} [H, a]^* & [F, a]^* \\ [E, a]^* & -[H, a]^* \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*} hence
\begin{equation*}
    [D_N, a]^* [D_N, a] 
    = \begin{pmatrix}
    [H, a]^*[H, a] + [E, a]^*[E, a] & \cdots \\
    \cdots & [H, a]^*[H, a] + [F, a]^*[F, a]
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
If in the equation for $||[D_N, a]||$ instead of taking the supremum over all $v \in H_N$ of unit norm we take it over all unit vectors of the form $(x, 0)^t$, and $(0, y)^t$, we obtain, respectively, the following lower bounds:
\begin{align}
    ||[D_N, a]||^2 &\geq ||[H, a]||^2 + ||[E, a]||^2 \\
    ||[D_N, a]||^2 &\geq ||[H, a]||^2 + ||[F, a]||^2,
\end{align}
and so the first inequalities follow.

If $a \in \acal_N = M_{N+1}(\CC)$ is diagonal, then $[H, a] = 0$ since $H = \pi_j(J^3)$ is also diagonal, and so
\begin{equation*}
    [D_N, a]^* [D_N, a] 
    = \begin{pmatrix}
    [E, a]^*[E, a] & 0 \\
    0 & [F, a]^*[F, a]
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
hence
\begin{equation}
    ||[D_N, a]|| = max\left\{ ||[E, a]||, ||[F, a]|| \right\}.
\end{equation}

Finally, $[D_N, a]^* = -[D_N, a^*]$ and $E = F^*$ imply that $[F, a] = - [E, a^*]^*$, so, if $a$ is hermitian and diagonal, $||[E, a]|| = ||[F, a]||$ and the last part of the statement follows.
\end{proof}

The general procedure to find the distance between two states will be the following: 

    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item Understand $||[D, a]||$ for an arbitrary $a \in \acal$; 
    
    \item find a small upper limit for $|\omega(a) - \omega(a')|$ dependent on $||[D, a]||$;
    
    \item find a hermitian algebra element that saturates the inequality of the upper limit (or a sequence that has this bound as limit).
    
    \end{enumerate}

% % \begin{equation}
% %     d_N(\psi_{(0,0), \psi_{(0, \pi)}}) = \sum_{k = 1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(N-k+1)}}
% % \end{equation}
% \textit{Pf}: Recall that $J^\pm|j,m\rangle = \sqrt{(j\mp m)(j\pm m + 1)}|j, m+1 \rangle$ $\longrightarrow$ $\omega_m(a) - \omega_n(a) = \sum_{k = m+1}^n \langle j, k-1 |a|j, k-1 \rangle - \langle j, k |a| j, k \rangle = \sum_{k = m+1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{(j+k)(j-k+1)}} \langle j, k| [E, a] |j, k-1 \rangle$; since $|\langle j, k |[E, a]|j, k-1 \rangle|  \leq ||[E, a]|| \leq ||[D_N, a]|| \leq 1$, we get the upper bound. 

% Define the diagonal hermitian operator $\hat a |j, m\rangle := - \left( \sum_{k = -j+1}^m  \right)|j, m\rangle$, $\longrightarrow$ $[E, \hat a] |j, k \rangle = |j, k+1\rangle$ ($k < j$), and so $\hat a$ saturates the inequality.
% }

Another family of pure states on each $\acal_N = End(V_j)$, for $N = 2j \in \NN$  is the family of vector states $\lbtext{\omega_m} := \langle j, m | \cdot | j, m \rangle$, where $m = -j, \dots, j-1, j$. The study of this distance will be useful to the study of coherent states.

\begin{theorem}\label{theoremDistanceDiscreteStates}
For any $N$:
\begin{equation}
    d_N(\omega_m, \omega_n) = \sum_{k = m+1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{(j+k)(j-k+1)}} = \sum_{k = m+1}^n d_N(\omega_{k-1}, \omega_k).
\end{equation}
In particular, the distance between this family of states is additive.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $E = J^+ = (J^-)^* \in U(\sut)$ and that, for $m \pm 1 = -j\pm 1, \dots, j$, $J^\pm|j,m\rangle = \sqrt{(j\mp m)(j\pm m + 1)}|j, m+1 \rangle$. Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
    \langle j, m | [E, a] |j, m - 1 \rangle &= \sqrt{(j+m)(j-m+1)} \langle j, m-1| a | j, m-1\rangle \\
    & -\sqrt{(j-m+1)(j+m)} \langle j, m| a | j, m\rangle
\end{align*}
Hence, 
\begin{align*}
    \omega_m(a) - \omega_n(a) &= \sum_{k = m+1}^n \langle j, k-1 |a|j, k-1 \rangle - \langle j, k |a| j, k \rangle \\
    &= \sum_{k = m+1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{(j+k)(j-k+1)}} \langle j, k| [E, a] |j, k-1 \rangle
\end{align*}
Applying the triangle inequality on the norm of the above equation, and using lemma \ref{lemmaRelationOperatorsAndDirac}$, |\langle j, k |[E, a]|j, k-1 \rangle|  \leq ||[E, a]|| \leq ||[D_N, a]|| \leq 1$, so we get the distance formula in the statement as an upper bound. 

Define the diagonal hermitian operator 
\begin{equation}\label{saturatingDiagonalADiscreteBasis}
    \hat a |j, m\rangle := - \left( \sum_{k = -j+1}^m \frac{1}{\sqrt{(j+k)(j-k+1}}  \right)|j, m\rangle.    
\end{equation} 
For this $\hat a$, $[E, \hat a] |j, m \rangle = |j, m+1\rangle$ for all $m = -j, \dots, j-1$, and so $\hat a$ saturates the inequality.
\end{proof}

% $\pi_{1/2}(J^k) = \sigma_k/2$

% - Any hermitian element in $\acal_1 = M_2(\CC)$ can be written as

% \end{align*}


% - Positivity of states implies that, restricted to hermitian elements, they all are  $\omega_{\vec x}(a) = a_0 + \vec x \cdot \vec a$, for $\vec x \in B^3 \subset \RR^3$.

% - $\omega_{\vec x}$ is pure $\iff$ $\vec x = (\sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta, \cos \theta) \in S^2$ $\dbtext{\iff}$ $\omega_x = \psi^1_{(\phi, \theta)}$.

% \rtext{\textbf{Theorem}}: For $N = 1$ all pure states are coherent states and 
% \begin{equation}

% \end{equation}
% \textit{Pf}: $|\omega_{\vec x}(b) - \omega_{\vec y}(b)| = |(\vec x - \vec y)\cdot \vec b| \leq |\vec x - \vec y||\vec b|$; $i[D_1, a]$ is hermitian with max. eigenvalue/norm $=2 |\vec a|$ $\longrightarrow$ $a \in \acal_1$ hermitian with $\vec a$ parallel to $\vec x - \vec y$ st. $2|\vec a| = 1$ saturates the inequality.
% }


Any hermitian element in $\acal_1 = M_2(\CC)$ can be written as
\begin{align*}
    a &= \begin{pmatrix} a_0 + a_3 & a_1 - i a_2 \\ a_1 + i a_2 & a_0 - a_3  \end{pmatrix}= a_0 + \vec a \cdot \vec \sigma, & \text{for $(a_0, \dots, a_3) \in \RR^4$.}
\end{align*}

Since very state $\omega: \acal_1 \to \CC$, in addition to its linearity over this $4$-dimensional vector space, must satisfy that $\omega(Id_2) = 1$ and $\omega(a^*a) \geq 0$, then, when evaluated on hermitian elements $a$ as above, every state must be of the form $\omega_{\vec x}(a) = a_0 + \vec x \cdot \vec a$, for $\vec x \in B^3 \subset \RR^3$.

This form for the states identifies the convex combination $\alpha \omega_{\vec x} + \beta \omega_{\vec y}$, i.e. $\alpha, \beta \in \RR_{\geq 0}$ and $\alpha + \beta = 1$, of states $\omega_{\vec x}$ and $\omega_{\vec y}$, with the convex combination points $\alpha\vec x + \beta\vec y$ in $B^3$. Hence, all pure states on $\acal_1$, i.e. those that can not be written as a convex combination of more than one state, are of the form $\omega_{E(\phi, \theta)}$ for $E(\phi, \theta):= (\sin \theta \cos \phi, \sin \theta, \cos \theta) \in S^2$. Furthermore \cite{DAndrea2013}:
%$\omega_{E(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^1_{(\phi, \theta)}$

\begin{proposition}
The set $\{\omega_{E(\phi, \theta)} \,|\, E(\phi, \theta)\}$ of pure states on $\acal_1$ coincides with the set of $SU(2)$-coherent states, under the equality $\omega_{E(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^1_{(\phi, \theta)}$.
\end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Shouldn't be too complicated once the correct framing is achieved...  AND IT CAN BE A GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE COHERENT STATES\todo{I would like to do this} $|j, j\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1&0 \end{pmatrix}$
% \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{N=1CaseDistance}
For $N = 1$ all pure states are coherent states and 
\begin{equation}
    d_1(\hat p, \hat q) = \frac{1}{2}|\vec p - \vec q|_{\RR^3},
\end{equation} where $|\cdot |_{\RR^3}$ denotes the euclidean norm in $\RR^3$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
As stated at the beginning of this section, we may restrict our search to hermitian elements. Let $a \in \acal_1 = M_2(\CC)$ be hermitian. Then,
\begin{align*}
    |\omega_{\vec x}(b) - \omega_{\vec y}(b)| &= |(\vec x - \vec y)\cdot \vec b| \\
        &\leq |\vec x - \vec y||\vec b|.
\end{align*}

Now, let $a_\pm = a_1 \pm i a_2$, so that $a = a_0 + a_+ \sigma_+ + a_- \sigma_- + a_3 \sigma_3$. Recall that $\pi_{1/2}(J^k) = \frac{\sigma_k}{2}$, $k = 1, 2, 3$, hence
\begin{equation*}
    [D_1, a] = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & a_+ & -a_+ & 0\\
    -a_- & 0 & 2a_3 & a_+ \\
    a_- & -2a_3 & 0 & -a_+ \\
    0 & -a_- & a_- & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and so $i[D_1, a]$ is hermitian, with characteristic polynomial $\lambda^2(\lambda^2 -4|\vec a|^2)$, so its norm is its maximum eigenvalue. Then 
\begin{equation*}
    ||[D_1, a]|| = 2 |\vec a|.
\end{equation*}

Therefore, if we choose $a \in \acal_1$ hermitian with associated $\vec a$ parallel to $\vec x - \vec y$ such that $2|\vec a| = 1$, this element saturates the inequality.
\end{proof}

In this subsection we will relate the coherent states and the algebras of subsequent $N$'s, which will then allow us to find a relation between $||[D_{N+1}, \cdot]||$ and $||[D_N, \cdot]||$ for any $N = 2j \in \NN$.

First define the linear injections, that respect the $SU(2)$ action,
\begin{align*}
    U^+_j : V_{j+\frac{1}{2}} &\to V_j \otimes V_{\frac{1}{2}}; 
    & U^-_j : V_{j-\frac{1}{2}} &\to V_j \otimes V_{\frac{1}{2}} \\
    \left|j + \frac{1}{2}, m + \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle &\mapsto |j, m\kket_+ &
    \left|j - \frac{1}{2}, m + \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle &\mapsto |j, m\kket_-,
\end{align*} where $|j, m\kket_\pm$ are the fuzzy spinors eigenvectors of $D_N$ defined in \ref{irreducibleDiracFuzzySpinorBasis}, and $m \pm 1 = -j \mp 1, \dots, j$ for $U_j^\pm$. 
%Notice that $H_N = V_j \otimes V_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is the orthogonal direct sum of the ranges of $U_j^+$ and $U_j^-$.
Then, using only the formula for the coherent states \eqref{equationCOherentRotation}, it can be easily shown that:

\begin{lemma}\label{relationCoherentVectorsDifferentN}
$U_+|\phi, \theta)_{N+1} = |\phi, \theta)_N \otimes |\phi, \theta)_1$ for any $E(\phi, \theta) \in S^2$.
\end{lemma}

Now, define the injective linear maps
\begin{align*}
    \eta^\pm_N &: \acal_N \to \acal_{N+1} \\
    a &\mapsto (U_j^\pm)^*(a \otimes 1_2) U_j^\pm.
\end{align*}

\begin{lemma} \label{relationDifferentNCoherentStates}
For any $a \in \acal_N$,
\begin{equation}
    \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)} \circ \eta_N^+(a) = \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This is a direct consequence of the definitions of $U_J^\pm$ and $\eta_N^+$, since
\begin{align*}
    (\phi, \theta| \eta^+_N(a) |\phi, \theta)_{N+1} &= (\phi, \theta|a|\phi, \theta)_N (\phi, \theta| \phi, \theta), & \text{lemma \ref{relationCoherentVectorsDifferentN}}\\
        &= (\phi, \theta| a | \phi, \theta)_N.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

Finally, using some more properties of the maps $U_j^\pm$ and $\eta^\pm_N$, together with the previous lemmas, the following can be proven:
\begin{lemma}\label{normCommutatorsDiracDifferentNRelation}
For any $a \in \acal_N$,
\begin{equation}
    ||[D_{N+1}, \eta^\pm(a)]|| \leq ||[D_N, a]||.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

From this relation between the norms of the commutators $[D_N, \cdot]$ for consecutive $N$'s, we can now show the following.

\begin{theorem}\label{nondecreasingDistanceRelatingNCoherent}
For any $N \geq 1$, the distance $d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')})$ is non-decreasing with $N$, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
    d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) \leq d_{N+1}(\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi', \theta')}).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
    d_{N+1}(\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi', \theta')}) 
        &= sup_{a \in \acal_{N+1}} \{|\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}(a) - \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi', \theta')}(a)| : ||[D_{N+1}, a]|| \leq 1\} \\
        &\geq sup_{a = \eta_N^+(b) \in \acal_{N+1}} \{|\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}(a) - \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi', \theta')}(a)| : ||[D_{N+1}, a]|| \leq 1\}\\
        &= sup_{a \in \acal_{N}} \{|\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}\circ \eta_N^+(a) - \psi^{N+1}_{(\phi', \theta')}\circ \eta_N^+(a)| : ||[D_{N+1},  \eta_N^+(a)]|| \leq 1\} \\
        &= sup_{a \in \acal_{N}} \{|\psi^{N}_{(\phi, \theta)}(a) - \psi^{N}_{(\phi', \theta')}(a)| : ||[D_{N+1}, \eta_N^+(a)]|| \leq 1\}\\
        &\geq sup_{a \in \acal_{N}} \{|\psi^{N}_{(\phi, \theta)}(a) - \psi^{N}_{(\phi', \theta')}(a)| : ||[D_{N}, a]|| \leq 1\} \\
        &= d_N(\psi^{N}_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^{N}_{(\phi', \theta')});
\end{align*} the fourth line is an application of lemma \ref{relationDifferentNCoherentStates}, and the fifth line of lemma \ref{normCommutatorsDiracDifferentNRelation}.
\end{proof}

An interesting upper bound is possible for the increasing sequence with $N$ that is the distance between any two coherent states associated to two points in the sphere.

\begin{theorem}\label{geometricDistanceCommutativeUpperBound}
For all $N$, and for all $E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta') \in S^2$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2}|E(\phi, \theta)- E(\phi', \theta')|_{\RR^3}  \leq d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) \leq d_{S^2}(E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta')),
\end{equation}
where $d_{S^2}$ is the usual distance within $S^2$, inherited from the metric $g = d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The lower bound is a simple consequence of the $N = 1$ distance found in theorem \ref{N=1CaseDistance} and of the nondecrease of the distance with $N$ found in theorem \ref{nondecreasingDistanceRelatingNCoherent}.

To prove the upper bound, thanks to the $SU(2)$-invariance of the distance between states proven in theorem \ref{theoGInvariantDistance}, we only need to prove it within the great circle $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e. we only need to prove that 
\begin{equation*}
    d_N(\psi^N_{(0, \frac{\pi}{2})}, \psi^N_{(\phi, \frac{\pi}{2})}) \leq |\phi|.
\end{equation*}

It can be shown that $\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}([H, a]) = -i \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}(a)$; this is a statement of the equivariance under $SU(2)$ of the identification of $SU(2)$-coherent states and points in $S^2$. Then the following calculation
\begin{align*}
    |\psi^N_{(\phi, \frac{\pi}{2})} - \psi^N_{(0, \frac{\pi}{2})}| 
        &= \left|i \int_0^\phi \psi^N_{(\alpha, \frac{\pi}{2})}([H, a]) d\alpha \right|  \\
        &\leq \left| \int_0^\phi d\alpha \right| \left| \psi^N_{(\alpha, \theta)}([H, a]) \right|\\
        &\leq |\phi|\,||[H, a]|| 
        & |\omega(a)| \leq ||a||,\,\forall\omega: \acal \ni a \to \CC\\
        &\leq |\phi|\, ||[D_N, a]||    & \text{Theorem \ref{ineqDN}}
\end{align*}
proves the desired upper bound.
\end{proof}

A final result, stating that the distance between any two coherent states associated to two points in the sphere is not only bounded by the euclidean distance between the points, but that in fact this is the limit distance when $N \to \infty$ can be shown. To do this, we use an auxiliary distance by limiting the algebra on which we maximize the norm of the difference of the evaluation of the states that appears in the definition of Connes' distance. By reducing the algebra the supremum over it will necessarily be a lower bound, but an exact formula for the distance will be possible.

Let $\lbtext{\bcal_N} \subset \acal_N$ be subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Notice that for any $a \in \bcal_N$, $\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^N_{(0, \theta)}$ for all $\phi$; also note that, for $|n|, |m| \leq j$, on the diagonal element $a$ with entries $a_{nm} = c_m \delta_{nm}$, $c_m = \omega_m(a)$, where $\omega_m$ is the vector state of $|j, m\rangle \in V_j$. Define
\begin{equation}
    \lbtext{\rho_N}(\theta) := sup_{a \in \bcal_N, a = a^*}\{|\psi^N_{(0, \theta)} - \psi^N_{(0, 0)}| : ||[D_N, a]|| \leq 1\}.
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemmaFormulaAuxiliaryDistanceAllN} \label{lemmaDerivativeAuxiliaryDistance}
For $N \in \NN$ fixed:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    
    \item Let $\hat a$ be diagonal hermitian element introduced in \eqref{saturatingDiagonalADiscreteBasis} to saturate the distance between the $\omega_m$'s
    \begin{align}
        \rho_N(\theta) &= \psi^N_{(0, \theta)}(\hat a) - \psi^N_{(0, 0)}(\hat a) \\
        &   = \sum_{k = 1}^N \binom{2j}{j+m} (\sin \frac{\theta}{2})^{2n} (\cos \frac{\theta}{2})^{2(N-n)}  \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(N - k+1)}}
    \end{align}
    
    \item $0 \leq \rho'_N(\theta) \leq 1$. In particular $\rho_N(\theta - \theta') \leq |\theta - \theta'| = d_{S^2}(E(0, \theta), E(0, \theta'))$.
    
    \item
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_{N}(\theta - \theta') \leq \rho_{N+1}(\theta - \theta')
    \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
(i) For a diagonal element $a$,  
\begin{equation*}
    \psi^N_{(0, \theta)}(a) = \sum_{k = 1}^N \binom{2j}{j+m} (\sin \frac{\theta}{2})^{2(j+m)} (\cos \frac{\theta}{2})^{2(j-m)} \omega_m(a),
\end{equation*}
hence $|\psi^N_{(0, \theta)}(a) - \psi^N_{(0, 0)}(a)|$ over the diagonal elements can be bounded by the claimed distance using the triangle inequality and the bound $|| \leq d_N(\omega_m, \omega_{-j}) = \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{k(N - k+1)}}$. Using $\hat a$ to saturate the inequality, we obtain the desired formula.

(ii) From the first formula of the first part of the lemma \ref{lemmaFormulaAuxiliaryDistanceAllN} we easily deduce that $\rho_N'(\theta) = \frac{d}{d\theta} \psi^N_{(0, \theta)} (\hat a)$. Furthermore, from the $SU(2)$-equivariance of the identification of coherent states and points in $S^2$, on the diagonal elements it follows that 
\begin{equation}
    \rho_N'(\theta) 
        =\frac{d}{d\theta} \psi^N_{(0, \theta)} (\hat a) 
        = \psi^N_{(0, \theta)}([E, \hat a])
        = (0, \theta| [E, \hat a] |0, \theta)_N,
\end{equation} 
where, recall, $[E, \hat a]$ is the ladder operator on $V_j$.

Since for every state $\omega$ is is true that $|\omega(a)| \leq ||a||$ for every $a$, we get the following inequality:
\begin{equation*}
    |\rho_N'(\theta)| = |\psi^N_{(0, \theta)}([E, \hat a])| \leq ||[E, a]|| \leq 1
\end{equation*}
recalling that $[E, \hat a]$ is the ladder operator on $V_j$, of unit norm. From expanding the formula $\rho_N'(\theta) = (0, \theta| [E, \hat a] |0, \theta)_N$ and using the equation \eqref{equationCOherentRotation} for the spin coherent states, the lower bound $0$ then follows by noticing that every term in the expansion is positive since $\theta \in [0, \pi]$.

(iii) This follows from adapting the proof of \ref{nondecreasingDistanceRelatingNCoherent}, but where we need to take into account that $\eta^+_N(\bcal_N) \subset \acal_{N+1}$ might not be contained in the diagonal subalgebra $\bcal_{N+1}$, but it is contained in an algebra $\bcal_{N+1}'$ conjugate to $\bcal_{N+1}$ through a unitary operator commuting with the $SU(2)$ action on $\acal_{N+1}$ ($\pi_{j + \frac{1}{2}}$); this equates to rotating the basis vectors of $V_{j + \frac{1}{2}}$ in a way that leaves invariant the $\psi^{N+1}_{(\phi, \theta)}$ unchanged. This allows us to write the first equation of the proof of \ref{nondecreasingDistanceRelatingNCoherent} by changing $\acal_{N+1}$ by $\bcal'_N$, and from then on simply changing $\acal_N$ by $\bcal_N$.
\end{proof}


The following lemma is last piece of our puzzle. \cite{DAndrea2013}.
\begin{lemma}: For all $N$ and $\theta \in [0, \pi]$, the sequence $\rho_N(\theta)$ converges uniformly to $\theta = d_{S^2}(E(0, 0), E(0, \theta))$ as $N\to \infty$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 Let $f_N(\theta) := \theta - \rho_N(\theta)$; since $f_N(0) = 0$ and, by the second part of the lemma \ref{lemmaFormulaAuxiliaryDistanceAllN}, $f_N'(\theta) \geq 0$, so for each $N$ the function $f_N(\theta)$ is nondecreasing and positive, so $|| \theta - f_N(\theta)||_\infty - sup_{\theta \in [0, \pi]} f_N(\theta) = f_N(\pi) = \pi - \rho_N(\pi)$. So, the uniform convergence follows if and only if $\lim_{N \to \infty} \rho_N(\pi) = \pi$. For fixed $\theta$, by the third part of lemma \ref{lemmaFormulaAuxiliaryDistanceAllN}, $\rho_N(\theta)$ is a nondecreasing sequence, and it is bounded above by $\pi$, so the sequence $\rho_N(\theta)$ is convergent and any subsequence has the same limit.
 
 By using the formula for $\rho_N(\pi)$ given in the first part of lemma \ref{lemmaFormulaAuxiliaryDistanceAllN}, 
 \begin{align*}
     \rho_N(\pi) &= 2 \sum_{k = 1}^{\frac{1}{2}(N-1)} \frac{1}{k (N - k + 1)} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{N+1}} \\
     &\geq \int_{1}^{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(N-x+1)}} = 2 &\arcsin \frac{N-1}{N+1},
 \end{align*} since the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x(N-x+1)}}$ is positive for $1 \leq x \leq $ and symmetric about $x = \frac{1}{2}(N+1)$ and monotonically decreasing\todo{...} for $1 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}(N+1)$. The sequence $2 \arcsin \frac{N-1}{N+1}$ converges monotonically to $\pi$ as $N \to \infty$ if we restrict to the subsequence of odd $N$'s, but this suffices to prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} \rho_N(\theta) = \pi$.
\end{proof}

From the previous lemma, and joining for completeness some previous results, the theorem follows.
\begin{theorem} \label{theoremdNWithRespectoTodS2}
For all $N \in \NN$ and all points $E(\phi, \theta)$ and $E(\phi', \theta')$ in the $2$-sphere:
$$
    \rho_N(\theta - \theta') \leq d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) \leq d_{S^2}(E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta')),
$$
and 
\begin{equation}
        \lim_{N \to \infty} d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) = d_{S^2}(E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta')).
