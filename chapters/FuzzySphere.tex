Presentacion:

Starting point \cite{DAndrea2013}: $S^2$ as the symmetric space $S^3/S^1$ of the compact semisimple Lie group $G = S^3$, $\mathfrak g = su(2)$.
    
- The canonical spectral triple, which is \textbf{$SU(2)$-equivariant} can be seen to come from a purely algebraic element $\mathcal D \in U(\mathfrak g) \otimes U(\mathfrak g)$:
    \begin{align*}
        U(\mathfrak g) \otimes U(\mathfrak g) &\to& U(\mathfrak g) \otimes Cl(\mathfrak g, -K) &\to& \mathcal B(L^2(G, SG)) \\
        1 \otimes 1 + 2 \sum_{k = 1}^3 J_k \otimes J_k &\mapsto& 1 \otimes 1 + \sum_k J_k \otimes \sigma_k &\mapsto& \left( \bigoplus_{l\in \bb N} \pi_l \right) \otimes \pi_{1/2}(\mathcal D)
    \end{align*}
- So $\slashed D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \partial_H & \partial_F \\ \partial_E & 1 - \partial_H\end{pmatrix} = \partial_E \otimes \sigma_1 + \partial_F \otimes \sigma_2 + \partial_H \otimes \sigma_3$ where $\partial_H = -i \partial_\phi$, $\partial_E = e^{i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta + i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right)$, $\partial_F = -\partial_E% = e^{-i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta - i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right)
$ are the actions of $J_3$, $J^\pm \in su(2)$ on $L^2(S^2)$ respectively. Its spectrum is $\{\pm l\} = \ZZ$ with multiplicities $2l$.%: L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2 \to L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2 = \oplus_{l \in \bb N} (\pi_l \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D)$
