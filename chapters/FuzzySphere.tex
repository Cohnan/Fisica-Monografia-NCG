The $2$-sphere $S^2$ as a metric space is $SU(2)$-invariant. This invariance will be seen to give rise to a series decomposition of the canonical Dirac operator on $S^2$. We will see how truncating this $SU(2)$-decomposition of the Dirac operator will give rise to equivariant spectral triples on the fuzzy sphere which inherit some of the nice properties of the canonical spectral triple and which allow the convergence of the fuzzy sphere to $S^2$ also as a metric space, in a precise sense to make precise in section \ref{FSsec:convergence}.

Although there are several ways to describe the canonical spectral triple on \todo{of/on?} $S^2$, the one that will be useful to use to define the spectral triples on the fuzzy sphere will be from understanding $S^2$ as \ptext{compact Riemannian symmetric\footnote{Symmetric space; U} space} $S^2 \cong G/U$ of the compact semisimple Lie group $G = SU(2)$.

Let $G$ be a compact semisimple Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\alg g$, where the semisiplicity means that the Killing form $K: \alg g \times \alg g \to \alg g$ of $\alg g$ is negative definite, giving $G$ a natural Riemannian manifold structure. For such a manifold $G$, and its symmetric spaces, the Dirac operator can be seen to arise \ref{} from an algebraic element $\lbtext{\dcal } \in U(\alg g)\times U(\alg g)$, where $\lbtext{U}(g)$ is \lbtext{the universal enveloping algebra} of the Lie algebra $\alg g$, i.e. the largest\todo{in what sense} \todo{complex?} unital, associative algebra containing $\alg g$ where the Lie bracket coincides with the commutator in $U(\alg g)$; it is important to remark that \otext{the representations of $\alg g$ are in a bijective correspondence with the modules over $U(\alg g)$}. In the explicit case where $G = SU(2)$,
\begin{equation}
    \lbtext{\dcal} := 1 \otimes 1 + 2 \sum_{k = 1}^3 J_k \otimes J_k \in U(\sut) \otimes U(\sut)
\end{equation}
where $J_k \in U(\sut), k = 1, \dots, 3$ are the basis of $\sut\otimes \CC$ such that $[J_i, J_j] = i \epsilon_{ijk} J_k$ (i.e. $J_k = \frac{\sigma_k}{2} = \pi_{1/2}(J_k)$). 

\lin

Let $\lbtext{\pi_j}: U(\sut) \to M_{2j+1} = End(\CC^{2j+1})$ be the spin $j \in \frac{\NN}{2}$ representation of $\sut$ where each element of the canonical basis $e_m \in \CC^{2j+1}$, $m = -j, \dots, j-1, j$ satisfies $\pi_j(\vec J^2)(e_m) = j(j+1) e_m$ and $\pi_j(J_3)(e_m) = m e_m$, where $\vec J^2$ is notation for $J_1^2 + J_2^2 + J_3^3 \in U(\sut)$.

Recall that the every continuous / square integrable / smooth function on $S^2$ may be decomposed in terms of spherical harmonics $Y^l_m \in L^2(S^2)$, $l \in \NN$, $m \in \{-l, \dots, l-1, l\}$, and the spaces $\tilde V_l = span\{Y^l_m\}_{|m| \leq l}$ for fixed $l$ are the spaces of homogeneous polynomials on the coordinates $x^1, x^2, x^3$ of $\RR^3$, which are precisely all the irreducible representation spaces of $SO(3)$, and another description of the spin-$l$ representations $V_l$ of $SU(2)$. 
This decomposition of $L^2(S^2)$ is in fact the one induced by the action of $SU(2)$, inherited from the action on $S^2$, and which can be seen to be induced by the natural action of $\sut$ on $S^2$ as vector fields. In particular, 
\begin{align}
    \partial_H &:= - i \partial_\phi & \text{is the action of $\lbtext{H} := J_3$ in $L^2(S^2)$} \\
    \partial_F &:= e^{i\phi} \left( \partial_\theta + i cot\,\theta \partial_\phi \right) &\text{is the action of $\lbtext{F} := J_+ = J_1 + i J_2$ in $L^2(S^2)$}\\
    \partial_E &:= - \partial_E &\text{is the action of $\lbtext{E} := J_- = J_1 - i J_2$ in $L^2(S^2)$}
\end{align} where $\phi$ and $\theta$ are the azimuthal and polar angles in $S^2$, respectively.
Hence, $L^2(S^2) \cong \bigoplus_{l = 0}^\infty V_l$ as representation spaces of $SU(2)$.

The spinor bundle of $S^2$ is trivial, so the space of spinor fields $\hcal = L^2(S^2, \Sigma S^2)$ of $S^2$ is isomorphic (as a vector space) to $L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2$, where $\CC^2$ is understood as the \textit{fermionic Fock space} associated to the tangent spaces of $S^2$, i.e. the unique irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra $\CC l_2 = M_2(\CC) = \pi_{1/2}(U(\sut))$. Therefore, \rtext{the spinor bundle of $S^2$ decomposes as representation of $SU(2)$ as $L^2(S^2, \Sigma S^2) \cong \bigoplus_{l = 1}^\infty V_l \otimes V_{1/2}$}; \ptext{we will understand from now on the separable Hilbert space $\lbtext{\hcal} = L^2(S^2)\otimes \CC^2$ as the space of spinor fields on the 2-sphere}.

\lin

This decomposition of the spinor bundle induced by the action of $SU(2)$ correctly suggests that the Dirac operator can be seen as the operator
\begin{equation}
    \lbtext{\slashed D} = \rtext{ \bigoplus_{l\in \bb N} \pi_l  \otimes \pi_{1/2}(\dcal)} = 1 + \partial_F \otimes \sigma_+ + \partial_E \otimes \sigma_- + \partial_H \otimes \sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \partial_H & \partial_F \\ \partial_E & 1 - \partial_H\end{pmatrix} ,
\end{equation} acting on $L^2(S^2)\otimes \CC^2$, where $\sigma \pm = \sigma_1 \pm i \sigma_2$.

The eigenvectors of $\slashed D$ $Y^{'}_{jm}, Y^{''}_{jm}$ $j \in \NN + 1/2$, $m = -j, \dots, j$, called the \textit{spinor harmonics}, make up an orthogonal basis of the spinor fields $\hcal$. The eigenvalue of the $Y'_{l\cdot}$ is $(j + 1/2) \in \NN$, and of the $Y{''}_{j\cdot}: -(l + 1/2)$, so the eigenvalue $j$ has multiplicity $2j+1$. The spectrum of $\slashed D$ (and the respective multiplicities) will be an indication of how good of an approximation is another Dirac operator in the Fuzzy sphere. 

{\color{gray}
The following aiding lemma will allow us to study the spectrum of the dirac operators of the dirac triples that will be defined on the fuzzy sphere.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemmaSpectrumAlgebraic}
The operator $(\pi_0 \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\dcal^2): V_0 \otimes \CC^2 \to V_0 \otimes \CC^2$ has as unique eigenvalue $1$ with multiplicity $2$. For any $j \in \frac{\ZZ_{\geq 1}}{0}$, the $(\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\dcal^2)$ has two eigenvalues: $j^2$ with multiplicity $2j$, and $(j+1)^2$ with multiplicity $2j+2$.
\end{lemma}

Now, to $\dcal \in U(\alg g) \otimes U(\alg g)$ corresponds an element $\dcal_S$ in the noncommutative Weil algebra\footnote{CCR algebra of $(\alg g, \omega?)$. } through the injection $\alg g \hookrightarrow Cl(g, K)$/$\alg g_\CC \hookrightarrow \CC l(G/U)?$\todo{not sure we want here the real algebra, and I even think we want instead the complex algebra since it is that one which acts on Fock space}\todo{not even sure if we want this CLifford algebra, of the one before, since it is that one which acts on the spinors on $S^2$, and so it is true that $\CC l_2 = M_2(\CC)$}\footnote{Clifford algebra}. It is known that, for a $3$ dimensional real vector space $V$ with positive definite metric with basis $\{v_k\}_{k = 1, \dots, 3}$, the real Clifford algebra $Cl(V, g) \cong gen\{\sigma_k\}_{k = 1, \dots, 3} = gen\{J_k\}_{k = 1, \dots, 3} = M_2(\CC)$ and $\CC l(V) \cong M_2(\CC) \oplus M_2(\CC)$ under the identification $v_k \Longleftrightarrow \sigma_k \in M_2(\CC)$, meaning, for our explicit example, that the algebra $Cl(\sut, -K) = M_2(\CC)$ 
\todo{there is an $i$ which I don't like when saying this last sentence}, and so the injection can be seen to be simply $\pi_{1/2} = Id_2$:
\begin{equation}
    \dcal_S := (Id_2 \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\dcal) = 1 \otimes 1 + \sum_{k = 1}^3 J_k \otimes \sigma_k = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + H & F \\ E & 1 - H \end{pmatrix} \in U(\sut)\otimes M_2(\CC)
\end{equation}
where $H = J_3$, $E = J_1 + iJ_2$ and $F = E^* \in U(\sut)$


Equivariance of $\dcal$: $U(\alg g)$ is a Hopf algebra\footnote{} with coproduct $\nabla: U(\alg g) \to U(\alg g) \times U(\alg g)$ such that $A \mapsto A \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes A$ for $A \in \alg g$.}

\linea

A \lbtext{fuzzy space} is a sequence of finite dimensional $C^*$-algebras $\{\acal_N\}_{N \in \NN}$ with increasing dimension which approximate, in some sense to be determined later/in the specific case \todo{is there a precise definition?}, a (commutative) $C^*$ algebra $\acal$ in the limit $N \to \infty$. When the commutative algebra encodes a topological space or a manifold with certain symmetry group $G$ that acts by homeomorphisms or diffeomorphisms, we require a fuzzy space to implement this symmetry, i.e. that $G$ acts on each $\acal_N$ by $*$-isomorphisms (the algebraic version of homeomorphisms\todo{be certain of this.}) and in a way compatible with the derivations of $\acal$ (algebraic version of diffeomorphisms).

With the full spectral triple defined below, the \textit{fuzzy sphere} will approximate $S^2$ as:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item A $C^*$-algebra acting on the Hilbert space of spinors \todo{Madore does this}.
    
    \item $SU(2)$ acts by ``diffeomorphisms'' on the space.
    
    \item A metric space on which $SU(2)$ acts by ``isometries''.
    
    \end{enumerate}

\lin 

To define the fuzzy sphere $\{\acal_N\}_{N \in \NN}$ we start with the decomposition of $\lbtext{\acal} = C(S^2) =  \bigoplus_{l \in \NN} \tilde V_l \cong L^2(S^2)$ \todo{different ``limits''} into irreducible representations of $SO(3)$, where, recall, $\tilde V_l$ is the vector space of homogeneous polynomials on the coordinates $x_1, x_2, x_3$ of $\RR^3$. This suggest the definition of $\lbtext{\acal'_N} := \bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \tilde V_l$, for all $N \in \NN$, as the elements of the sequence conforming the fuzzy sphere. This definition seems appropriate in at least two ways: there is a clear way in which they approximate $\acal$; $SU(2)$ acts naturally on each $\acal_N'$.

However, an obvious problem with this definition is that $\acal_N'$ doesn't have a natural multiplication, so it isn't an algebra. From the case $N = 1$ there is a suggestion on how to define a multiplication\cite{Madore}: requiring that the radical\footnote{} of the algebra be zero, there are only two possibilities, and only one being noncommutative:
\begin{align}
    x_i &\mapsto \hat x_i := \lambda \sigma_i & i = 1, 2, 3;
\end{align}
where $\lambda\in \CC$ is any constant; this means that we are defining the $N = 1$ element of the fuzzy sphere to be $\lbtext{\acal_1} := M_2(\CC)$. Notice that the identification $x_i \mapsto \hat x_i$ is $SU(2)$-covariant since $\frac{\sigma_i}{2} \in U(\sut) \cong U(\alg{so(3)})$ corresponds to the generator of rotations with respect to the $x_i$-axis. The constant $\lambda$ is chosen such that ``radius of the sphere be $1$'', meaning that $\hat x_1^2 + \hat x_2^2 + \hat x_3^2 = 1$, hence $\lambda = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{2} + 1)}}$.

Instead of insisting on defining a foreign multiplication in $\acal'_N$, the \lbtext{fuzzy sphere} is now defined by $\lbtext{\acal_N} :=  \pi_{j}(U(\sut)) \equiv End(V_j)$ which, when the irreducible representation $\pi_j$ of $SU(2)$ is defined as in the previous subsection where $V_j = \CC^{N+1}$, $\acal_N \equiv M_{N+1}(\CC)$ for all $N \in \NN$, $j$ satisfying $N =: 2\lbtext{j}$, which arises from the following generalization of the $N = 1$ case studied above:
\begin{align}
    \tilde V_1 \hookrightarrow \bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \tilde V_l &\to \acal_N\\
    x_i &\mapsto \hat x_i := \frac{1}{j(j+1)} \pi_{j}(J_i) & i = 1, 2, 3;
\end{align} that is, for each $N$, the coordinate $x_i$ is understood as the infinitesimal rotation with respect to the axis $x_i$ operator on the space $V_j = \CC^{N+1}$. The normalization constant guarantees again $\hat x_1^2 + \hat x_2^2 + \hat x_3^2 = 1$, and we now obtain in general the \rtext{nonzero commutation relation ``of the coordinates''}:
\begin{align}
    \rtext{[\hat x^i, \hat x^j] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{j(j+1)}} i \epsilon_{ijk} \hat x_k}, && i, j, k \in \{1, 2, 3\},
\end{align} where sum over repeated indices is understood, and $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita tensor.

\lin

This \textit{fuzzy} version of the sphere is, so far, good in two of the three ways stated at the beginning of this subsection:

\subsubsection{$SU(2)$ acts by diffeomorphisms}

From the $SU(2)$-equivariance of the identifications $x_i \to \hat x_i$, we see that $\acal_N \cong \acal'_N \cong \bigoplus_{l=0}^N V_l$ as representation space of $SU(2)$, where the action of $g \in SU(2)$ is the one induced in $\acal_N$ seen as $End(V_j)$, namely by the inner automorphism $B  \mapsto \pi_j(g)B \pi_j(g)^{-1}$, where $\pi_j(g) \in SU(N+1)$ since $\pi_j$ is an unitary representation. That $(\pi_j(g)B \pi_j(g)^{-1})^* = \pi_j(g)B^* \pi_j(g)^{-1}$, where $B^*$ is the adjoint of $B \in M_{N+1}(\CC)$, shows that \rtext{$SU(2)$ acts by $*$-automorphisms on $\acal_N$}.

A diffeomorphism of $S^2$ is equivalent to an automorphism of the algebra $C^\infty(S^2)$ (dense subalgebra of $\acal$) that respects the complex conjugation $*$. In the matrix algebras $M_{N+1}(\CC)$, since they are simple, all $*$-automorphisms are precisely of the form $B \mapsto C B C^{-1}$ for some $C \in SU(N+1)$. Furthermore, all such automorphisms also respect the derivations of $\acal_N$, which are the noncommutative analogues of vector fields. Hence, all $*$-automorphisms of $\acal_N$ are good analogues of diffeomorphisms of $S^2$, and so \rtext{$SU(2)$ \textit{is acting by diffeomorphisms on the fuzzy sphere}}.

\subsubsection{As $C^*$-algebra}

The elements $\hat x_i \in \acal_N$, $i = 1, 2, 3$ generate the algebra; furthermore, each element in $a \in \acal_N$ has a unique expansion $a = \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \hat x_{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots \hat x_{a_{l}}$, where $a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \in \CC$ is symmetric and trace free as a tensor. Replacing the coordinates $x_i$ by $\hat x_i$ in the polynomial expansion of the spherical harmonics $Y^l_m$, $l = 0, \dots, N$ and $|m| \leq l$, we obtain the \lbtext{fuzzy harmonics} $\hat Y^l_m \in \acal_N$ that make up a basis of $\acal_N$.

Define the linear, injective mapping
\begin{align}
    \acal_N &\to \acal'_N \subset \acal \\
    \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} \hat x_{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots \hat x_{a_{l}} &\mapsto \sum_{l = 0}^N \frac{1}{l!} a_{\mu_1 \cdots a_l} x_{a_{\mu_1}}  \cdots x_{a_{l}}.
\end{align}
Then, the sequence of noncommutative $C^*$-algebras approximates the commutative algebra $A = C(S^2)$ in the limit $N \to \infty$ in the sense that the above map gets increasingly closer to being an algebra morphism and \textbf{the algebra $A$ can be considered as the image of the diagonal matrices in $\acal_N$}; the precise statements and their proofs may be found in \cite{Madore}.

\section{Spectral Triples}

% {\color{gray} --  Truncate the $SU(2)$-equivariant \textbf{decomposition} of the canonical spectral triple}

The introduction of a spectral triple on each unital algebra $\acal_N$ that conforms the fuzzy sphere will introduce the notion of distance between states of the algebra, opening the door to the study of geometry on this spaces. Furthermore, we would like to introduce a spectral triple that somehow allows us to think of the fuzzy sphere as an approximation of $S^2$ also as metric spaces. 

In this document, this will occur in the following senses:

    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The spectrum (and the multiplicities of the eigenvalues) of the Dirac operator approximates that of $\slashed D$ as $N$ increases
    
    \item To each point in $S^2$ there is a corresponding pure state on each $\acal_N$, and the distance between the coherent states corresponding to two points in $S^2$ tends to the commutative distance between the points as $N \to \infty$.
    
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$SU(2)$-equivariance}

Rotating the 2-sphere leaves invariant not only its topological and differential properties, but it also leaves invariant the metric, $g = d\theta^2 + \sin^2(\theta) d\theta^2$, implying that the distance between any $2$ points is the same as the distance between the rotated points, under any rotation $h \in SO(3)$. Since $SU(2)$ is the double covering of $SO(3)$, there is a $2$-to-$1$ Lie group morphism $SU(2) \to SO(3)$ under which any rotation $h \in SO(3)$ corresponds to two distinct points $\pm \tilde h \in SU(2)$. From this it follows that each element of $SU(2)$ acts as a rotation on $S^2$, so that \rtext{$SU(2)$ is also a group of symmetries of $S^2$ that acts by diffeomorphisms and isometries}. Notice, however, that the most general symmetry group of $S^2$ is the orthogonal group $O(3)$, which includes reflections under planes on $\RR^3$ that pass through the origin.

One important property of the spectral triples that will be defined on the fuzzy sphere is their equivariance under $SU(2)$, or more generally the Hopf algebra $U(\sut)$ as defined in\cite{Sitarz}, giving an analogous notion to the action of these symmetry spaces by isometries. The precise definition of a \textit{spectral triple $(\acal, \hcal, \dcal)$ equivariant under a symmetry space $H$}, $H$ being called \textit{the isometry of the spectral triple}, is fairly involved, but, ignoring some details, reduces to the following:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item $\acal$ is a representation of $H$.
    
    \item $\hcal $ is a representation of $H$.
    
    \item The action of $H$ on $\acal$ coincides with the action $\acal$ as subalgebra of operators on $H$, i.e. the adjoint action $A \mapsto g \circ A \circ g^{-1}$. %there is a dense subspace $V$ of $\hcal$ on which the action induced on operators
    
    \item The \textit{Dirac operator is equivariant}, i.e. the operator $[\dcal, h] = 0$ for all $h \in H$.
    
    \end{itemize}
\ref{theoInvDistance}
\textbf{For the spectral triples defined in this section, the $SU(2)$-equivariance reduces to the verification of the last two conditions}, since the first two ones are readily satisfied. The following theorem, which will apply to all the spectral triples defined in this chapter, illustrates how this notion of equivariance induces a notion of isometry on the respective noncommutative spaces.

\begin{theorem} \label{theoGInvariantDistance}
Let $(\acal, \hcal, \dcal)$ be a spectral triple. Let $G$ be a group, let $\hcal$ and $\acal$ be representation spaces of $G$, with $G$ acting unitarily on $H$. Then, if for all $g \in G$, $[D, g\cdot] = 0$ and the action on $A$ coincides / interwines with the induced action on $A$ as subalgebra of operators on $H$, then $SU(2)$ acts by isometries on the state space $\mathcal S(\acal)$. That is, for all $g \in G$:
\begin{align}
    d_\dcal(\omega, \omega') &= d_\dcal(g_* \omega, g_*\omega'), & \text{for all $\omega, \omega' \in \mathcal S(\acal)$};
\end{align}
we have denoted by $g^*\omega$ the action of $G$ on $\mathcal S(\acal)$, $g^* \omega: \acal \to \CC$, $a \mapsto \omega(a^g)$, induced from the action $a \mapsto a^g$ of $G$ on $\acal$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The theorem follows once we show that 
\begin{equation}\label{normEqualDiracAction}
    \rtext{||[\dcal, a^g]|| = ||[\dcal, a]||},
\end{equation} since, in that case,
\begin{align*}
d_\dcal(g_* \omega, g_* \omega') &= sup_{a \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(a^g) - \omega'(a^g)|: ||[\dcal, a \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} \\
    &= sup_{b \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(b) - \omega'(b)|: ||[\dcal, b \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} \\
    &= d_\dcal(\omega, \omega'),
\end{align*}
since $b = a^g$, for fixed $g \in SU(2)$, sweeps all $\acal_N$ if $a$ does.

Now, denoting the action of $G \ni g$ on $\hcal$ by $g \cdot$:
\begin{align*}
    (g \cdot) \circ [\dcal, a]\circ (g\cdot )^* &= (g \cdot) \circ [\dcal, a]\circ (g^{-1}\cdot )\\
        &= (g \cdot) \circ \dcal \circ a \circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) - (g \cdot) \circ a \circ  \dcal \circ (g^{-1}\cdot )\\
        &= \dcal (g \cdot) \circ a\circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) - (g \cdot) \circ a\circ (g^{-1}\cdot ) \dcal & \text{$\dcal$ commutes with $g\cdot$} \\
        &= \dcal \circ a^g - a^g \circ \dcal & \text{actions of $g$ and $\acal$ interwine} \\
        & = [\dcal, a^g].
\end{align*} The desired equality \eqref{normEqualDiracAction} follows from this calculation, and from the unitarity of the operators $(g \cdot)$ and $(g\cdot)^*$.

% }    
\linea

This spectral triple, although unsatisfactory as an approximation of the canonical spectral triple of $S^2$ with respect to the first criteria stated at the beginning of the section, will turn out to be very useful for computations.

\begin{definition}
For each $N \in \NN$ and $j = N/2$, define the \lbtext{irreducible spectral triple} as $(\acal_N, \lbtext{H_N} := V_j \otimes \CC^2, D_N = (\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D))$, where $\acal_N = End(V_j)$ acts naturally on the first factor of $H_N$.
\end{definition}

This spectral triple may be seen to come as a single term of the $SU(2)$-induced expansion of $\slashed D$ \eqref{}, although we are also allowing  half integer spin representations in the current construction, which don't appear in the expansion of $\slashed \dcal$. The Dirac operators can also be written as
\begin{equation}
    D_N = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \pi_j(H) & \pi_j(F) \\ \pi_j(E) & 1 - \pi_j(H)\end{pmatrix} 
    = 1 + \pi_j(F) \otimes \sigma_+ + \pi_j(E) \otimes \sigma_- + \pi_j(H) \otimes \sigma_3
\end{equation}
where $H = J_3$, $F = J_+$, $E = J_-$ are the respective actions of $J_3$, $J^+, J^- \in U(\sut(2))$ on $V_j$.

We have said before that this spectral triple is $SU(2)$-equivariant, but for this to make sense we first need to define an action of $SU(2)$ on $\acal_N$ and $H_N$, both of which will be inherited from the untitary representation $\pi_j$ of $SU(2)$ on $V_j$. Since $\acal_N = End(V_j)$, the action of each $SU(2) \ni g$ induces the adjoint action on its operators, $a \mapsto \lbtext{a^g} := \pi_j(g) a \pi_j(g)^*$. Similarly, on $H_N = V_j \otimes V_{1/2}$ we may define the unitary left action of $g \in SU(2)$ by $u_g := \pi_j(g) \otimes \pi_{1/2} \in \mathcal B(H_n)$; notice that, when $j \in \NN$, this representation is one of the terms of the decomposition of the representation of $\hcal = L^2(S^2) \otimes \CC^2$ into representations of $SU(2)$ \eqref{}.

\begin{proposition}
For each $N \in \NN$, the irreducible spectral triple:

    \begin{itemize}
        
    \item Is $SU(2)$-equivariant
    
    \item Has eigenvalues $j+1$ and $-j$ with multiplicities $2j+2$ and $2j$.
        
    \item Isn't compatible with a grading or a real structure.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
As stated at the beginning of the section, to proof the $SU(2)$-equivariance follows from $[D_N, u_g] = 0$ and $u_g  a  u_g^* \equiv u_g \circ (a \otimes 1) \circ u_g^* = a^g \otimes 1 \equiv a_g$.

That those are the eigenvalues and their multiplicities follows from finding eigenvectors $|j, m \kket_+$ and $|j, m\kket_-$, $|m| \leq j$ with the mentioned eigenvectors, and deducing that these are all thanks to the lemma \ref{lemmaSpectrumAlgebraic}.

If the spectral triple had a grading, the Dirac operator would have a symmetric spectrum, hence this can't be the case.

A real structure doesn't exist since, if it did, its commutant would have dimension greater than $4 = $

\begin{definition}
For each $N \in \NN$, $j = N/2$, the \lbtext{full spectral triple} is $(\acal_N, \lbtext{\hcal_N} := \mathcal A_N \otimes \CC^2, \lbtext{\mathcal D_N} := (\text{ad}\pi_j \otimes \pi_{1/2})(\mathcal D) )$, where $a \in \acal_N$ acts on the first factor of $\hcal_N$ via the commutator $[a, \cdot]$.
\end{definition}

Notice that the action of $\acal_N$ on itself is simply the derivative of the action $B \mapsto \pi_j(g) B \pi_j(g)^{-1}$ of $SU(2) \ni g$ on $\acal_N = End(V_j)$. Under the $SU(2)$-induced decomposition of $\acal_N$, the Hilbert space $\hcal_N$ is isomorphic to $\bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l$, where the representation $\text{ad}\pi_j$ then corresponds to the representation $\bigoplus_{l = 0}^N \pi_l$, in which case the Dirac operator $\dcal_N$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal D_N : \hcal_N \to \hcal_N  \iff \bigoplus_{l =1}^N D_l: \bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l \to \bigoplus_{l =1}^N H_l.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}
The full spectral triples satisfies:
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item It is a real spectral triple.
    
    \item It is $SU(2)$-equivariant
    
    \item The spectrum of $\mathcal D_N$ is the truncation of $\slashed D$ to $\{-N, \dots, N+1\}$, ie. the eigenvalues of $\mathcal D_N$ are $N+1$ with multiplicity $2N+2$, and $\pm l$ with multiplicity $2l$ for $l = 1, \dots, N$.
    
    \item It is not compatible with a grading.
    
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\rtext{The third statement of the theorems says that we have found a spectral triple with the desired property of being a truncation of the canonical spectral triple of $S^2$}. Hence, this will be the spectral triple which we will assign the forming algebras of the fuzzy sphere, under which the metric properties are to be studied, since it \rtext{may be considered a sequence of spectral triple that approximate the metric of $S^2$ increasingly better with growing $N$}. However, the following theorem allows us to study instead the much simpler irreducible spectral triple.

\begin{theorem}
The irreducible and full spectral triple on $\acal_N$, for each $N \in \NN$, induce the same distance in the state space of $\acal_N$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\omega, \omega'$ be states on $\acal_N$. Notice that distinct spectral triples induce different notions of distance only due to the condition $||[D, a]|| \leq 1$, which determines over which elements $a$ of the algebra the supremum of $|\omega(a) - \omega'(a)|$ is evaluated. However, for all $a \in \acal$, $||[\dcal_N, a]|| = ||[D_N, a]||$ as shown by the following calculation:
\begin{align*}
    [\dcal, a]b \otimes v = \cdots = \sum_k [\pi_j(J_k), a]b \otimes \sigma_k v = [D_N, a] \cdot b \otimes v.
\end{align*}
This tells us that $[\slashed D_N, a]: \hcal_N \to \hcal_N$ is the operator of left multiplication by the matrix $[D_N, a] \in \acal_N \otimes M_2(\CC)$, implying that its operator norm coincides with the norm of the matrix $[D_N, a]$.

\section{Coherent States}\todo{Complement with intro given in Fiore and Pisacane}
 {\color{gray}
% -- Fuzzy approximations of points in S2. In QM they are the closes thing to classical states we have (minimum uncertainty states for some observables).

- \dbtext{Are they pure}? They are vector states, I think that suffices to make them pure.
}

We now define the Bloch or $SU(2)$-coherent states in each $\acal_N$. Given $N$, each coherent state is labeled by a point in $S^2 = SU(2) / S^1$, allowing us to interpret each coherent state as a fuzzy approximation of a point in $S^2$. Furtheremore, the fuzzyness of this approximation decreases as $N \to \infty$ since theorem \ref{} shows that the distance between coherent states corresponding to two points in $S^2$ tends to the respective distance in $S^2$. 

In quantum mechanics, coherent states were first introduced for the quantum version of the simple harmonic oscillator, as minimum uncertainty states for position and momentum, making them states whose time evolution is the closest to that of the corresponding classical evolution. Since then, many generalizations have emerged, using mainly one of the following properties of the system of coherent states $\{|\alpha\rangle\}_{\CC}$ of the simple harmonic oscillator:
    \begin{enumerate}
        
    \item Each $|\alpha\rangle$ saturates the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
    
    \item Each $|\alpha\rangle$ are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, with eigenvalue $\alpha \in \CC$
    
    \item $\{|\alpha\rangle\}$ is generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group acting on the vacuum $|0\rangle$
        
    \end{enumerate}
Particularly Perolomov \cite{Perolomov} defines systems of coherent states using $(3)$ for various Lie groups $G$ acting on a Hilbert space with a chosen vacuum vector $|0\rangle$, in which case the coherent states are vectors of the Hilbert space, they are labeled by topological space $G/H$; if $|0\rangle$ satisfies certain conditions, then the properties $(1)$ and $(2)$ are also satisfied.

\linea

Due to theorem \ref{}, although the full spectral triple seems to be a better approximation of the canonical spectral triple due to the properties of the spectrum of $\dcal_N$, it suffices to study the distances using the irreducible spectral triple since it induces exactly the same notion of distance on each $\acal_N$. From now on we will stop writing the symbols $\pi_j$ unless confusion may arise.

\begin{remark}
If $\acal$ is a unital $C^*$-algebra, and $D$ is an associated Dirac operator, the supremum  $d_\dcal(\omega, \omega')$, of $|\omega(a) - \omega'(a)|$ for $a \in \acal$ such that $||[D, a]|| \leq 1$, is always attained in hermitian $(a = a^*)$ elements \ref{Rieffel30,33}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A state may be defined from its action on hermitian elements of the $C^*$-algebra $\acal$, since from there it can be uniquely extended to all of $\acal$, since any $a \in \acal$ can be written as $a = \frac{a+a^*}{2} + \frac{a - a^*}{2} \in Herm. + Antiherm. = Herm. + i\, Herm$.
\end{remark}

The general procedure to find the distance between two states will be the following: 

    \begin{enumerate}
    
    \item Understand $||[D, a]||$ for an arbitrary $a \in \acal A$; 
    
    \item find upper limit for $|\omega(a) - \omega(a')|$ dependent on $||[D, a]||$;
    
    \item find a hermitian algebra element that saturates the inequality (or a sequence that has this bound as limit).

\textbf{\rtext{Theorem}}: For all $N = 2j \in \bb N$, the distance is $SU(2)$-invariant:

$d_N(g_* \omega, g_* \omega') = sup_{a \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(a^g) - \omega'(a^g)|: ||[D_N, a \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} = sup_{b \in \acal_N}\{ |\omega(b) - \omega'(b)|: ||[D_N, b \otimes 1_2]|| \leq 1 \} = d_N(\omega, \omega')$, where $b = a^g$ sweeps all $\acal_N$.

\textit{Pf}: $[D_N, a^g \otimes 1] = u[D_N, a \otimes 1_2]u^*$ where $u = \pi_j(g) \otimes \pi_{1/2}(g)$ is the induced unitary action of $g$ in $H_N$ $\xleftarrow{}$
1. $a^g \otimes 1_2 = u(a \otimes 1_2)u^*$;

 - Study simpler subalgebra distance: lower bound whose behavior is understood and that encases the actual distance, allowing approximate study.

Presentation:

Distance along diagonal, hermitian matrices eassier to understand, but useful.

 KEY: find simpler (we understand [D, a] if a is diagonal hermitian), but useful auxiliary distance (gives a lower bound that sandwhiches the actual distance)
 
Let $\lbtext{\bcal_N} \subset \acal_N$ be sugalgebra of diagonal matrices $\xrightarrow{}$ $\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^N_{(0, \theta)}$, now 
$\lbtext{\rho_N}(\theta) := sup_{a \in \bcal_N, a = a^*}\{|\psi^N_{(0, \theta)} - \psi^N_{(0, 0)}| : ||[D_N, a]|| \leq 1\}$: \textbf{1.} exact formula related to $\omega_m$ states, \textbf{2.} $0 \leq \rho'_N(\theta) \leq 1$ $\xrightarrow{}$ $\rho_N(\theta) \leq \theta$, \textbf{3.} non-decreasing with $N$.


\textbf{Lemma}: For all $N$, 
\begin{align*}
    1.& \rho_N(\theta - \theta') \leq d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) d_{geo}(E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta'))  ; \\
    2.& \text{the sequence $\rho_N(\theta)$ converges uniformly to $\theta$ as $N\to \infty$} \leq .
\end{align*}

\textbf{\rtext{Theorem}}:  
\begin{equation}
        \lim_{N \to \infty} d_N(\psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)}, \psi^N_{(\phi', \theta')}) = d_{geo}(E(\phi, \theta), E(\phi', \theta'))
\end{equation}

{\color{gray} 
 - This identification of points in $S^2$ with coherent states ($\psi^N: \acal_N \to L^2(S^2)$ at the algebra level) \todo{???}
is $SU(2)$-equivariant: $g_* \psi^N_{(\phi, \theta)} = \psi^N_{g\cdot (\phi, \theta)}$, \& \rtext{the distance between them is $SU(2)$-invariant}.
 
 - as: \textbf{1.} $C^*$-algebra $\acal$ acting on the spinor fields $\hcal$; \textbf{2.} Representation of $SU(2)$: homeomorphisms?\todo{homeomorphisms? Symmetries?}; \textbf{3.}  Metric space on which $SU(2)$ acts by isometries.
