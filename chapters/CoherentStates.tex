-- Coherent states are, apparently, crucial if we want these spaces to have applications

-- The weak system of coherent states $\mathcal W^d$ is made of the states minimizing $(\Delta \vec x)^2$: they are related to the diagonalization of the coordinates $x_i$; they are $O(D)$-invariant.

-- A class of $O(D)$-invariant strong SCS are introduced, and in particular an interesting one is $\mathcal S^d$ which minimizes, within this class of CS, $(\Delta \vec x)^2$

-- The diagonalization of the position observables seems to be improved on their last paper
